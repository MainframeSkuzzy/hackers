<div id='otxpost'> Name: The NukeBot banking Trojan: from rough drafts to real threats // Description: This spring, the author of the NukeBot banking Trojan published the source code of his creation. He most probably did so to restore his reputation on a number of hacker forums: earlier, he had been promoting his development so aggressively and behaving so erratically that he was eventually suspected of being a scammer. Now, three months after the source code was published, we decided to have a look at what has changed in the banking malware landscape. // Refs.: https://securelist.com/the-nukebot-banking-trojan-from-rough-drafts-to-real-threats/78957/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/2334262952439855899386565449655.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: BlackEnergy APT Attacks in Ukraine employ spearphishing  Word // Description: Late last year, a wave of cyber-attacks hit several critical sectors in Ukraine. Widely discussed in the media, the attacks took advantage of known BlackEnergy Trojans as well as several new modules.BlackEnergy is a Trojan that was created by a hacker known as Cr4sh. In 2007, he reportedly stopped working on it and sold the source code for an estimated $700. The source code appears to have been picked by one or more threat actors and was used to conduct DDoS attacks against Georgia in 2008. These unknown actors continued launching DDoS attacks over the next few years. Around 2014, a specific user group of BlackEnergy attackers came to our attention when they began deploying SCADA-related plugins to victims in the ICS and energy sectors around the world. This indicated a unique skillset, well above the average DDoS botnet master. // Refs.: https://securelist.com/blog/research/73440/blackenergy-apt-attacks-in-ukraine-employ-spearphishing-with-word-documents/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/423236843935594644854928.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: Linux/ShellBind // Description: This more recent malware is detected as ELF_SHELLBIND.A and was found on July 3. Similar to the previous reports of SambaCry being used in the wild, it also opens a command shell on the target system. But ELF_SHELLBIND.A has marked differences that separate it from the earlier malware leveraging SambaCry. For one, it targets internet of things (IoT) devices--particularly the Network Attached Storage (NAS) devices favored by small to medium businesses. ELF_SHELLBIND also targets different architectures, such as MIPS, ARM, and PowerPC. This is the first time we&#x27;ve seen SambaCry being exploited without the cryptocurrency miner as a payload. // Refs.: http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/linux-users-urged-update-new-threat-exploits-sambacry/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/455922339332655528525386266.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: Spoofed UK Fuels Collection malspam delivers malware, possibly Trickbot // Description: An email with the subject of UK Fuels Collection  pretending to come from invoices@ebillinvoice.com  with a malicious word doc  attachment  delivers some sort of malware. I am not sure what these are. They might be Jaff ransomware or might be Dridex banking Trojan or Trickbot banking Trojan. The last time I saw proshuto8.exe  it was Trickbot, but these malware gangs do mix &amp;amp; match and reuse file names and delivery methods to deliver multiple different malwares. // Refs.: https://myonlinesecurity.co.uk/spoofed-uk-fuels-collection-malspam-delivers-malware-possibly-trickbot/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/34668482896295483532584498656868626.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: Ding! Your RAT has been delivered // Description: DarkKomet is a freeware remote access trojan that was released by an independent software developer. It provides the same functionality you would expect from a remote access tool: keylogging, webcam access, microphone access, remote desktop, URL download, program execution, etc. One interesting thing is that it added some other functions you wouldn&#x27;t expect to try and emphasize it wasn&#x27;t a malicious tool by including a piano game and &quot;fun manager&quot;.

<div id='otxpost'> Name: Rocket Kitten: A campaign with 9 lives // Description: Since early 2014, an attacker group of Iranian origin has been actively targeting personsof interest by means of malware infection, supported by persistent spear phishingcampaigns. This cyber-espionage group was dubbed &#x27;Rocket Kitten,&#x27; and remains activeas of this writing, with reported attacks as recent as October 2015.The Rocket Kitten group and its attacks have been analyzed on numerous occasions byseveral vendors and security professionals, resulting in various reports describing thegroup&#x27;s method of operation, tools and techniques.Characterized by relatively unsophisticated technical merit and extensive use of spearphishing, the group targeted individuals and organizations in the Middle East (includingtargets inside Iran itself), as well as across Europe and in the United States. // Refs.: http://blog.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/rocket-kitten-report.pdf // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/43339553486858462622544382.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: CARBANAK GROUP USES GOOGLE FOR MALWARE COMMAND-AND-CONTROL // Description: Forcepoint Security Labs(tm) recently investigated a trojanized RTF document which we tied to the Carbank criminal gang. The document contains an encoded Visual Basic Script (VBScript) typical of previous Carbanak malware. Recent samples of the malware have now included the ability to use Google services for command-and-control (C&amp;amp;C) communication. We have notified Google of the abuse and are working with them to share additional information.Carbanak (also known as Anunak) are a group of financially motivated criminals first exposed in 2015. The actors typically steal from financial institutions using targeted malware. Recently a new Carbanak attack campaign dubbed &amp;quot;Digital Plagiarist&amp;quot; was exposed where the group used weaponized office documents hosted on mirrored domains, in order to distribute malware. // Refs.: https://blogs.forcepoint.com/security-labs/carbanak-group-uses-google-malware-command-and-control // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/58898568934694865442848822442.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: Taiwan targeted with new cyberespionage backdoor Trojan // Description: In late August 2015, Symantec identified a previously unknown back door Trojan (Backdoor.Dripion) infecting organizations primarily located in Taiwan, as well as Brazil and the United States. Dripion is custom-built, designed to steal information, and has been used sparingly in a limited number of targeted attacks. The attackers behind this campaign went to some lengths to disguise their activities, including using domains names disguised as antivirus (AV) company websites for their command and control (C&amp;amp;C) servers. These attacks have some links to earlier attacks by a group called Budminer involving the Taidoor Trojan (Trojan.Taidoor).The threat posed by custom malware such as Dripion illustrates the value of multilayered security. Unknown threats may evade signature-based detection, but can be blocked by other detection tools which identify malicious behavior. // Refs.: http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/taiwan-targeted-new-cyberespionage-back-door-trojan // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/2928663232448834895232649.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: Talos ShadowGate Take Down: Global Malvertising Campaign Thwarted // Description: Exploit kits are a class of threat that indiscriminately aims to compromise all users. Talos has continued to monitor this threat over time resulting in large scale research and even resulting in a large scale takedown. The focus of this investigation is on the tools and techniques being used to drive users to the exploit kits. This blog looks at the anatomy of a global malvertising campaign and how users interact with exploit kit gates, regardless of the sites they visit and the countries they reside. Talos observed a large malvertising campaign affecting potentially millions of users visiting sites in North America, Europe, Asia Pac, and the Middle East. The research culminated in a joint effort with GoDaddy to mitigate the threat by taking back the registrant accounts used to host the activity, and taking down all applicable subdomains. This is yet another example of how organizations work together to stop threats affecting users around the globe. // Refs.: http://blog.talosintel.com/2016/09/shadowgate-takedown.html // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/254243863334849996954545355.json</div>

Yesterday (January 19th) we discovered a new wave of these attacks, where a number of electricity distribution companies in Ukraine were targeted again following the power outages in December. What&#x27;s particularly interesting is that the malware that was used this time is not BlackEnergy, which poses further questions about the perpetrators behind the ongoing operation. The malware is based on a freely-available open-source backdoor - something no one would expect from an alleged state-sponsored malware operator. // Refs.: http://www.welivesecurity.com/2016/01/20/new-wave-attacks-ukrainian-power-industry // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/5536436394539966263599325335494338499.json</div>

In fact, our team considers them some of the best adversaries out of all the numerous nation-state, criminal and hacktivist/terrorist groups we encounter on a daily basis. In particular, we identified advanced methods consistent with nation-state level capabilities including deliberate targeting and &#x27;access management&#x27; tradecraft - both groups were constantly going back into the environment to change out their implants, modify persistent methods, move to new Command &amp;amp; Control channels and perform other tasks to try to stay ahead of being detected. // Refs.: https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/bears-midst-intrusion-democratic-national-committee/ , https://www.threatconnect.com/tapping-into-democratic-national-committee/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/525554348646329633358839.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: Digging for groundhogs: holes in your linux server // Description: In July 2015, Check Point&#x27;s Incident Response team was contacted by a customer after they noticed strange file system activities in one of their Linux-based DNS BIND servers. This strange behavior consisted of a large amount of peculiar files being written into sensitive system directories. A thorough analysis of the infected system by our Incident Response and Malware Research teams quickly revealed that the server was indeed compromised. The source of this compromise was traced to an SSH brute force attack that took place earlier the same month. The attacking IP addresses originated from very distinctive network ranges mostly associated with Chinese Internet  service providers. Using this SSH brute-forcing network, it took the attackers only a few days to gain root access and full control of the targeted server. Once they obtained access to the server, the  attackers infected the system with two malicious payloads. // Refs.: http://blog.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/sb-report-threat-intelligence-groundhog.pdf // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/49262229322358296336544.json</div>
