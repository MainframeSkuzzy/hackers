<div id='otxpost'> Name: New Attacks Linked to C0d0s0 Group // Description: Unit 42 discovered new activity that appears related to an adversary group previously called &quot;C0d0so0&quot; or &quot;Codoso&quot;. This group is well known for a widely publicized attack involving the compromise of Forbes.com, in which the site was used to compromise selected targets via a watering hole to a zero-day Adobe Flash exploit. Compared to other adversary groups, C0d0so0 has shown the use of more sophisticated tactics and tools and has been linked to leveraging zero-day exploits on numerous occasions in combination with watering hole and spear phishing attacks.In the newly discovered attack campaign, Unit 42 identified attacks targeting organizations within the telecommunications, high tech, education, manufacturing, and legal services industries. The attacks likely were initially delivered via spear-phishing e-mails, or as demonstrated by C0d0so0 in the past, legitimate websites that had been previously compromised then used as watering holes for the selected victims. // Refs.: http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/01/new-attacks-linked-to-c0d0s0-group/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/6658966649626494655592296926.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: The return of HackingTeam with new implants for OS X // Description: Last week, Patrick Wardle published a very nice analysis of a new Backdoor and Dropper used by HackingTeam, which is apparently alive and well. Since HackingTeam implants are built on-demand for each target, we wanted to take a closer look: to see how it works and what its functionality reveals about the possible interest of the attackers behind this latest Backdoor. // Refs.: https://securelist.com/blog/research/74063/the-return-of-hackingteam-with-new-implants-for-os-x/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/5283824492658944955946439234936.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: Wild Neutron - Economic espionage threat actor returns // Description: A powerful threat actor known as &quot;Wild Neutron&quot; (also known as &quot;Jripbot&quot; and &quot;Morpho&quot;) has been active since at least 2011, infecting high profile companies for several years by using a combination of exploits, watering holes and multi-platform malware.The latest round of attacks in 2015 uses a stolen code signing certificate belonging to Taiwanese electronics maker Acer and an unknown Flash Player exploit.Wild Neutron hit the spotlight in 2013, when it successfully infected companies such as Apple, Facebook, Twitter and Microsoft. This attack took advantage of a Java zero-day exploit and used hacked forums as watering holes. The 2013 incident was highly publicized and, in the aftermath, the threat actor went dark for almost one year. // Refs.: https://securelist.com/blog/research/71275/wild-neutron-economic-espionage-threat-actor-returns-with-new-tricks/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/6559448495634393264424654865445.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: Threat Group-3390 Targets Organizations for Cyberespionage // Description: Dell SecureWorks Counter Threat Unit(TM) (CTU) researchers investigated activities associated with Threat Group-3390[1] (TG-3390). Analysis of TG-3390&#x27;s operations, targeting, and tools led CTU researchers to assess with moderate confidence the group is located in the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The threat actors target a wide range of organizations: CTU researchers have observed TG-3390 actors obtaining confidential data on defense manufacturing projects, but also targeting other industry verticals and attacking organizations involved in international relations. The group extensively uses long-running strategic web compromises[2] (SWCs), and relies on whitelists to deliver payloads to select victims. In comparison to other threat groups, TG-3390 is notable for its tendency to compromise Microsoft Exchange servers using a custom backdoor and credential logger. // Refs.: http://www.secureworks.com/cyber-threat-intelligence/threats/threat-group-3390-targets-organizations-for-cyberespionage/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/53623326955238425934369326.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: Terracotta VPN: Enabler of Advanced Threat Anonymity // Description: Today, RSA Research published an in-depth report on a commercial VPN network, originating in China, which we are calling &quot;Terracotta&quot;.  It is being used as a launch platform for APT actors including the now well-known Shell_Crew / Deep Panda group.Terracotta&#x27;s network of 1500+ VPN nodes throughout the world are primarily obtained by hacking into inadequately protected Windows servers in legitimate organizations, without the victim&#x27;s knowledge or permission.  New nodes are continually added as new victims are enlisted, and they are unpublished outside of the Terracotta user-base. // Refs.: https://blogs.rsa.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Terracotta-VPN-Report-Final-8-3.pdf // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/45835458439582866845634244.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: Defaulting on Passwords (Part 1): r0_bot // Description: Early in March, while studying the ChinaZ threat, it became readily apparent that default passwords were being used for more than just a supplementary attack vector. Several bots relied heavily, if not exclusively, on systems with weak and/or default passwords to spread. We setup a system with weak and default passwords to capture any and all malware spread in this fashion. For this first test, I selected 5 sets of passwords; admin/admin, guest/guest, ubnt/ubnt, cisco/cisco and ADMIN/ADMIN (the last for picking up folks scanning for Supermicro IPMI devices). Unsurprisingly, it took just under 3 hours for the first infection to hit. What did surprise us though was what password combination was first to be hit; ubnt/ubnt. // Refs.: http://blog.cari.net/carisirt-defaulting-on-passwords-part-1-r0_bot/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/3943894899845533633699226.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: Tofsee - modular spambot // Description: Tofsee, also known as Gheg, is another botnet analyzed by CERT Polska. Its main job is to send spam, but it is able to do other tasks as well. It is possible thanks to the modular design of this malware - it consists of the main binary (the one user downloads and infects with), which later downloads several additional modules from the C2 server - they modify code by overwriting some of the called functions with their own. An example of some actions these modules perform is spreading by posting click-bait messages on Facebook and VKontakte (Russian social network).Bot communicates with the botmaster using non-standard protocol built on top of TCP. The first message after establishing the connection is always sent by the server - the most important thing it contains is a random 128-byte key used for encrypting further communication. It is therefore impossible to decode the communication if one wasn&#x27;t listening right from its beginning. // Refs.: https://www.cert.pl/en/news/single/tofsee-en/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/48456369699964994565862532.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: Similarities Between Carbanak and FIN7 Malware Suggest Actors Are Closely Related // Description: Several days ago, researchers at FireEye attributed a recent phishing campaign to FIN7, a campaign in which cybercriminals delivered malicious Microsoft Office documents to users, deploying both Cobalt Strike and a VBS-based backdoor on infected workstations. This report contained a sentence of particular interest to Cyber4Sight: &quot;FIN7 is referred to by many vendors as &#x27;Carbanak Group,&#x27; although we do not equate all usage of the Carbanak backdoor with FIN7.&quot; In their previous report on this threat actor group, FireEye stopped short of making this direct connection, stating instead that &quot;The use of the CARBANAK malware in FIN7 operations also provides limited evidence that these campaigns are linked to previously observed CARBANAK operations leading to fraudulent banking transactions, ATM compromise, and other monetization schemes.&quot; // Refs.: https://blog.cyber4sight.com/2017/04/similarities-between-carbanak-and-fin7-malware-suggest-actors-are-closely-related/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/884683224848929569989426993583.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: New activity of the Blue Termite APT // Description: In October 2014, Kaspersky Lab started to research &quot;Blue Termite&quot;, an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) targeting Japan. The oldest sample we&#x27;ve seen up to now is from November 2013. This is not the first time the country has been a victim of an APT. However, the attack is different in two respects: unlike other APTs, the main focus of Blue Termite is to attack Japanese organizations; and most of their C2s are located in Japan. One of the top targets is the Japan Pension Service, but the list of targeted industries includes government and government agencies, local governments, public interest groups, universities, banks, financial services, energy, communication, heavy industry, chemical, automotive, electrical, news media, information services sector, health care, real estate, food, semiconductor, robotics, construction, insurance, transportation and so on. Unfortunately, the attack is still active and the number of victims has been increasing. // Refs.: https://securelist.com/blog/research/71876/new-activity-of-the-blue-termite-apt/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/4222535834368264624862984846245243.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: Exploring Bergard: Old Malware with New Tricks // Description: The Bergard Trojan and the C0d0so group that made it famous with the November 2014 watering hole attack [1] via Forbes.com have received renewed attention recently, with other researchers [2] potentially linking emerging tools and recent attacks to the group. Proofpoint researchers conducted a historical analysis of samples related to this research and uncovered new malware variants and likely origins and methods of infection. Many of these samples have not been discussed publicly and several have very little or no anti-virus coverage. The analysis that follows is of completed, historical attacks as well as an extremely recent and ongoing attack, providing insight into the volume and timeline of infections, as well as a timeline for attacker-initiated actions using a novel malware family. // Refs.: https://www.proofpoint.com/us/exploring-bergard-old-malware-new-tricks // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/3456558629956863553633888.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: Hellsing APT // Description: The Hellsing APT group is currently active in the APAC region, hitting targets mainly in the South China Sea area, with a focus on Malaysia, the Philippines and Indonesia. The group has a relatively small footprint compared to massive operations such as &quot;Equation&quot;. Smaller groups can have the advantage of being able to stay under the radar for longer periods of time, which is what happened here. // Refs.: https://securelist.com/analysis/publications/69567/the-chronicles-of-the-hellsing-apt-the-empire-strikes-back/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/8494838486854462393564289243569.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: BAIJIU: New Malware Abuses Popular Japanese Web Hosting Service // Description: BAIJIU&#x27;s goal in this attack was to deploy a set of espionage tools through a downloader we call TYPHOON and a set of backdoors we call LIONROCK.Three distinctive elements of BAIJIU drew and held our attention: the unusual complexity of the attack; the appropriation of web hosting service GeoCities (of 1990s fame); and the use of multiple methods of obfuscation. // Refs.: https://www.cylance.com/en_us/blog/baijiu.html // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/989425386633333654.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: FIN7 Evolution and the Phishing LNK // Description: FIN7 is a financially-motivated threat group that has been associated with malicious operations dating back to late 2015. FIN7 is referred to by many vendors as &quot;Carbanak Group&quot;, although we do not equate all usage of the CARBANAK backdoor with FIN7. FireEye recently observed a FIN7 spear phishing campaign targeting personnel involved with United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings at various organizations.In a newly-identified campaign, FIN7 modified their phishing techniques to implement unique infection and persistence mechanisms. FIN7 has moved away from weaponized Microsoft Office macros in order to evade detection. This round of FIN7 phishing lures implements hidden shortcut files (LNK files) to initiate the infection and VBScript functionality launched by mshta.exe to infect the victim. // Refs.: https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/04/fin7-phishing-lnk.html // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/8822263824938685835393425692649.json</div>

Emissary is related to the Elise Trojan and the Operation Lotus Blossom attack campaign, which prompted us to start collecting additional samples of Emissary.The oldest sample we found was created in 2009, indicating this tool has been in use for almost seven years. Of note, this is three years earlier than the oldest Elise sample we have found, suggesting this group has been active longer than previously documented. In addition, Emissary appears to only be used against Taiwanese or Hong Kong based targets, all of the decoys are written in Traditional Chinese, and they use themes related to the government or military. // Refs.: http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/02/emissary-trojan-changelog-did-operation-lotus-blossom-cause-it-to-evolve/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/52498963295294343295865438499.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: VB Dropper and Shellcode for Hancitor Reveal New Techniques Behind Uptick // Description: The Hancitor downloader has been relatively quiet since a major campaign back in June 2016. But over the past week, while performing research using Palo Alto Networks AutoFocus, we noticed a large uptick in the delivery of the Hancitor malware family as they shifted away from H1N1 to distribute Pony and Vawtrak executables. In parallel, we received reports from other firms and security researchers seeing similar activity, which pushed us to look into this further.The delivery method for these documents remained consistent to other common malicious e-mail campaigns. Lures contained subjects related to recent invoices, or other matters requiring the victim&#x27;s attention, such as an overdue bill. These lures were expected, until we started digging into the actual documents attached and saw an interesting method within the Visual Basic (VB) macros in the attached documents used for dropping the malware. // Refs.: http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/08/unit42-vb-dropper-and-shellcode-for-hancitor-reveal-new-techniques-behind-uptick/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/668938529923554826623266295439.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: Duke APT group&#x27;s latest tools: cloud services and Linux support // Description: Recent weeks have seen the outing of two new additions to the Duke group&#x27;s toolset, SeaDuke and CloudDuke. Of these, SeaDuke is a simple trojan made interesting by the fact that it&#x27;s written in Python. And even more curiously, SeaDuke, with its built-in support for both Windows and Linux, is the first cross-platform malware we have observed from the Duke group. While SeaDuke is a single - albeit cross-platform - trojan, CloudDuke appears to be an entire toolset of malware components, or &quot;solutions&quot; as the Duke group apparently calls them. These components include a unique loader, downloader, and not one but two different trojan components. CloudDuke also greatly expands on the Duke group&#x27;s usage of cloud storage services, specifically Microsoft&#x27;s OneDrive, as a channel for both command and control as well as the exfiltration of stolen data. Finally, some of the recent CloudDuke spear-phishing campaigns have born a striking resemblance to CozyDuke spear-phishing campaigns from a year ago. // Refs.: https://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/00002822.html // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/4262564432922264523685526493.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: CARBANAK GROUP USES GOOGLE FOR MALWARE COMMAND-AND-CONTROL // Description: Forcepoint Security Labs(tm) recently investigated a trojanized RTF document which we tied to the Carbank criminal gang. The document contains an encoded Visual Basic Script (VBScript) typical of previous Carbanak malware. Recent samples of the malware have now included the ability to use Google services for command-and-control (C&amp;amp;C) communication. We have notified Google of the abuse and are working with them to share additional information.Carbanak (also known as Anunak) are a group of financially motivated criminals first exposed in 2015. The actors typically steal from financial institutions using targeted malware. Recently a new Carbanak attack campaign dubbed &amp;quot;Digital Plagiarist&amp;quot; was exposed where the group used weaponized office documents hosted on mirrored domains, in order to distribute malware. // Refs.: https://blogs.forcepoint.com/security-labs/carbanak-group-uses-google-malware-command-and-control // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/58898568934694865442848822442.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: Lurk: Retracing the Group&#x27;s Five-Year Campaign // Description: The cybercriminal group Lurk was one of the first to effectively employ fileless infection techniques in large-scale attacks--techniques that arguably became staples for other malefactors. A typical Lurk infection uses browser exploits to deliver non-persistent payloads to potential victims, probing their targets before deploying additional malware. The infection chain had multiple stages, and was accomplished using bodiless/fileless exploit payloads executed in-memory without additional persistence mechanisms. No traces were left on affected systems apart from files from the exploit process if the target machine wasn&#x27;t interesting to the Lurk operators. This eponymous lurking behavior would earn them notoriety until their operations were stymied and the perpetrators arrested. Lurk was believed to have siphoned over $45 million from financial organizations, ultimately disrupting the victims&#x27; operations, reputation, and bottom line. // Refs.: http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/lurk-retracing-five-year-campaign/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/894262334565986625844869396852.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: Putter Panda activity // Description: In 2014, our colleagues at Crowdstrike wrote an expose about a long-standing Chinese APT threat group they self-named Putter Panda, which Mandiant/FireEye refers to as APT2. This threat group has been around for quite a while, and commonly operated tangentially to APT1 intrusions into defense contractors and aerospace companies. We&#x27;ve been tracking a series of exploit documents which, upon successful exploitation, simply drop a file and perform no other actions; these documents have dropped a variety of backdoors associated with a range of previously identified threat groups. One of them was of particular interest because we&#x27;d never seen the backdoor before and it leveraged a relatively unique German dynamic DNS provider for command and control. // Refs.: http://blog.cylance.com/puttering-into-the-future // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/46496935822899254924398226.json</div>

This week the spam party did not just include CERBER, but also decided to invite an old friend - the KOVTER family. In 2015, KOVTER, a click-fraud malware, made headlines when it used a file-less technique similar to the POWERLIKS trojan. The KOVTER malware embeds a JavaScript into the registry and executes a PowerShell script which eventually loads the main KOVTER binaries. This kind of persistence has made it difficult for security vendors to detect the malware. // Refs.: https://www.trustwave.com/Resources/SpiderLabs-Blog/KOVTER-and-CERBER-on-a-One-Two-Punch-using-Fake-Delivery-Notification/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/3882445996568656855926.json</div>

We mostly observe attacks using Elirks occurring in East Asia. One of the unique features of the malware is that it retrieves its C2 address by accessing a pre-determined microblog service or SNS. Attackers create accounts on those services and post encoded IP addresses or the domain names of real C2 servers in advance of distributing the backdoor. We have seen multiple Elirks variants using Japanese blog services for the last couple of years. Figure 1 shows embedded URL in an Elirks sample found in early 2016. // Refs.: http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/06/unit42-tracking-elirks-variants-in-japan-similarities-to-previous-attacks/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/499839822823344962334565.json</div>

Its code contains a reference to Sauron, the all-seeing antagonist in Lord of the Rings.Strider&#x27;s attacks have tentative links with a previously uncovered group, Flamer. The use of Lua modules, which we&#x27;ll discuss later, is a technique that has previously been used by Flamer. One of Strider&#x27;s targets had also previously been infected by Regin. // Refs.: http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/strider-cyberespionage-group-turns-eye-sauron-targets , http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/Symantec_Remsec_IOCs.pdf , https://securelist.com/files/2016/07/The-ProjectSauron-APT_IOCs_KL.pdf // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/65538835835663554348844393.json</div>

The backdoor Trojan authors have called it XAgentOSX, which shares the name XAgent with one of Sofacy&#x27;s Windows-based Trojan and references Apple&#x27;s previous name for macOS, OS X. It appears the same actor developed both the Komplex and XAgentOSX tools, based on similarities within the following project paths found within the tools. // Refs.: http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2017/02/unit42-xagentosx-sofacys-xagent-macos-tool/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/56655324385584953558828564385224.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: BBSRAT Attacks Targeting Russian Organizations // Description: In late 2014, ESET presented an attack campaign that had been observed over a period of time targeting Russia and other Russian speaking nations, dubbed &quot;Roaming Tiger&quot;. The attack was found to heavily rely on RTF exploits and at the time, thought to make use of the PlugX malware family.ESET did not attribute the attacks to a particular attack group, but noted that the objective of the campaign was espionage and general information stealing. The adversaries behind these attacks continued to target Russia and other Russian speaking nations using similar exploits and attack vectors. However, while the malware used in these new attacks uses similar infection mechanisms to PlugX, it is a completely new tool with its own specific behavior patterns and architecture. We have named this tool &quot;BBSRAT.&quot; // Refs.: http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2015/12/bbsrat-attacks-targeting-russian-organizations-linked-to-roaming-tiger/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/266533959852542339258669235285.json</div>

The malware used in the new attacks was a variant of the infamous Shamoon worm that targeted Saudi Aramco and Rasgas back in 2012.Also known as Disttrack, Shamoon is a highly destructive malware family that effectively wipes the victim machine. A group known as the Cutting Sword of Justice took credit for the Saudi Aramco attack by posting a Pastebin message on the day of the attack (back in 2012), and justified the attack as a measure against the Saudi monarchy. // Refs.: https://securelist.com/blog/research/77725/from-shamoon-to-stonedrill/ , https://securelist.com/files/2017/03/Report_Shamoon_StoneDrill_final.pdf // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/6546393358833838985.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: MajikPOS Combines PoS Malware and RATs to Pull Off its Malicious Tricks // Description: Crooks behind MajikPOS have various tricks up their sleeves. Apart from infecting systems withit, we also spotted instances where common lateral movement tools were detected around thesame time they were actively compromising the endpoint with MajikPOS. These tools include:HKTL_MIMIKATZ, HKTL_FGDUMP, and HKTL_VNCPASSVIEW. We surmise that the badguys attempted to gain further access within the victim&#x27;s network. In separate isolated incidents,we also noticed the deployment of MajikPOS via PsExec, a command-line tool that can be usedto remotely execute processes on other systems. This may indicate that valid, administrative levelcredentials were used against the host. The attackers also tend to deploy what works orwhat&amp;#39;s convenient, as we&#x27;ve also seen them attempt to infect the target host with other PoSmalware such as PwnPOS (TSPY_PWNPOS.SMA), and BlackPOS (TSPY_POCARDL.AI). // Refs.: http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/majikpos-combines-pos-malware-and-rats/ , https://documents.trendmicro.com/assets/majikpos-combines-pos-malware-and-rats-to-pull-off-its-malicious-tricks.pdf // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/4586839849638294986648224925.json</div>

There has been considerable discussion about domain fronting following the release of a paper detailing these techniques. Domain fronting provides outbound network connections that are indistinguishable from legitimate requests for popular websites.APT29 has used The Onion Router (TOR) and the TOR domain fronting plugin meek to create a hidden, encrypted network tunnel that appeared to connect to Google services over TLS. This tunnel provided the attacker remote access to the host system using the Terminal Services (TS), NetBIOS, and Server Message Block (SMB) services, while appearing to be traffic to legitimate websites. The attackers also leveraged a common Windows exploit to access a privileged command shell without authenticating. // Refs.: https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/03/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/56265323853288386583389555869.json</div>

These  key  technologies  allow  RSA  analysts  to  process massive  datasets  and  find  forensically  interesting artifacts in near real-time and more quickly than using standard incident response processes. // Refs.: https://blogs.rsa.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/RSA-IR-Case-Study.pdf // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/36558439245863399665443382.json</div>
