<div id='otxpost'> Name: Taiwan targeted with new cyberespionage backdoor Trojan // Description: In late August 2015, Symantec identified a previously unknown back door Trojan (Backdoor.Dripion) infecting organizations primarily located in Taiwan, as well as Brazil and the United States. Dripion is custom-built, designed to steal information, and has been used sparingly in a limited number of targeted attacks. The attackers behind this campaign went to some lengths to disguise their activities, including using domains names disguised as antivirus (AV) company websites for their command and control (C&amp;amp;C) servers. These attacks have some links to earlier attacks by a group called Budminer involving the Taidoor Trojan (Trojan.Taidoor).The threat posed by custom malware such as Dripion illustrates the value of multilayered security. Unknown threats may evade signature-based detection, but can be blocked by other detection tools which identify malicious behavior. // Refs.: http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/taiwan-targeted-new-cyberespionage-back-door-trojan // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/2928663232448834895232649.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: An analysis of exploit supply chains and digital quartermasters // Description: On July 5, 2015 an unknown hacker publicly announced on Twitter that he had breached the internal network of Hacking Team - an Italian pentesting company known to purchase 0-day exploits and produce their own trojans. The hacker proceeded to leak archives of internal Hacking Team tools and communications. A number of tools and previously unknown exploits were discovered in the trove of data posted online. In the attached paper we will focus on two exploits which at the time of discovery in the Hacking Team archives were unpatched. The two 0-days in question targeted Adobe Flash and were subsequently labeled CVE-2015-5119 and CVE-2015-5122. // Refs.: http://blog.shadowserver.org/2015/08/10/the-italian-connection-an-analysis-of-exploit-supply-chains-and-digital-quartermasters/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/2459384466893668343636262925598242693524.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: CARBANAK GROUP USES GOOGLE FOR MALWARE COMMAND-AND-CONTROL // Description: Forcepoint Security Labs(tm) recently investigated a trojanized RTF document which we tied to the Carbank criminal gang. The document contains an encoded Visual Basic Script (VBScript) typical of previous Carbanak malware. Recent samples of the malware have now included the ability to use Google services for command-and-control (C&amp;amp;C) communication. We have notified Google of the abuse and are working with them to share additional information.Carbanak (also known as Anunak) are a group of financially motivated criminals first exposed in 2015. The actors typically steal from financial institutions using targeted malware. Recently a new Carbanak attack campaign dubbed &amp;quot;Digital Plagiarist&amp;quot; was exposed where the group used weaponized office documents hosted on mirrored domains, in order to distribute malware. // Refs.: https://blogs.forcepoint.com/security-labs/carbanak-group-uses-google-malware-command-and-control // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/58898568934694865442848822442.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: New Carbanak / Anunak Attack Methodology // Description: In the last month Trustwave was engaged by two separate hospitality clients, and one restaurant chain for investigations by an unknown attacker or attackers. The modus operandi for all three investigations were very similar and appear to be a new Carbanak gang attack methodology, focused on the hospitality industry. Carbanak is a prolific crime group, well known for stealing over one billion dollars from banks in 2015 (*Kaspersky estimated loss) and more recently orchestrating an attack on the Oracle Micros POS support site that put over one million Point of Sale systems at risk. The current investigations are still underway but the known indicators of compromise in these new attacks will be presented below. At the time of investigation this malware was not correctly detected by any existing antivirus engines, and domains / IP&amp;#39;s were not found in any commercial threat intelligence feeds. // Refs.: https://www.trustwave.com/Resources/SpiderLabs-Blog/New-Carbanak-/-Anunak-Attack-Methodology/?page=1&amp;amp;year=0&amp;amp;month=0 // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/824394428999696266334922245948.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: Operation Iron Tiger // Description: Key individuals, who are believed to be part of a China-based attack group, have been stealing years of valuable government and corporate information from defense and high technology organizations in the US since 2013 and political and government-related entities in China, Hong Kong, and the Philippines since 2010.This shift in targets is highly notable for the active cyber espionage operation we dubbed as &quot;Operation Iron Tiger.&quot; We believe that the threat actors have simply moved up in the food chain and were assigned new, high-level targets to spy on-all as part of a bigger espionage campaign.US defense contractors were only fairly recent targets based on the operation&#x27;s history, which we traced to spear-phishing in 2010. &quot;Foreign policy,&quot; &quot;future of the US Army Officer Corps,&quot; and &quot;economic development&quot; are only a few of the keywords that threat actors have been using in spear-phishing attacks against directors and project managers of technology-inclined US government contractors. // Refs.: http://www.trendmicro.com/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/white-papers/wp-operation-iron-tiger.pdf , http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/operation-iron-tiger-how-china-based-actors-shifted-attacks-from-apac-to-us-targets/ , http://documents.trendmicro.com/assets/pdf/operation-iron-tiger-appendix.pdf // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/385644988289484829455238942242.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: BlackEnergy APT Attacks in Ukraine employ spearphishing  Word // Description: Late last year, a wave of cyber-attacks hit several critical sectors in Ukraine. Widely discussed in the media, the attacks took advantage of known BlackEnergy Trojans as well as several new modules.BlackEnergy is a Trojan that was created by a hacker known as Cr4sh. In 2007, he reportedly stopped working on it and sold the source code for an estimated $700. The source code appears to have been picked by one or more threat actors and was used to conduct DDoS attacks against Georgia in 2008. These unknown actors continued launching DDoS attacks over the next few years. Around 2014, a specific user group of BlackEnergy attackers came to our attention when they began deploying SCADA-related plugins to victims in the ICS and energy sectors around the world. This indicated a unique skillset, well above the average DDoS botnet master. // Refs.: https://securelist.com/blog/research/73440/blackenergy-apt-attacks-in-ukraine-employ-spearphishing-with-word-documents/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/423236843935594644854928.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: Talos ShadowGate Take Down: Global Malvertising Campaign Thwarted // Description: Exploit kits are a class of threat that indiscriminately aims to compromise all users. Talos has continued to monitor this threat over time resulting in large scale research and even resulting in a large scale takedown. The focus of this investigation is on the tools and techniques being used to drive users to the exploit kits. This blog looks at the anatomy of a global malvertising campaign and how users interact with exploit kit gates, regardless of the sites they visit and the countries they reside. Talos observed a large malvertising campaign affecting potentially millions of users visiting sites in North America, Europe, Asia Pac, and the Middle East. The research culminated in a joint effort with GoDaddy to mitigate the threat by taking back the registrant accounts used to host the activity, and taking down all applicable subdomains. This is yet another example of how organizations work together to stop threats affecting users around the globe. // Refs.: http://blog.talosintel.com/2016/09/shadowgate-takedown.html // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/254243863334849996954545355.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: Sandworm to Blacken: The SCADA Connection // Description: On October 14th, a report was publicly released regarding the Sandworm team.  After beginning an investigation into the affiliated malware samples and domains, we quickly came to realization that this group is very likely targeting SCADA-centric victims who are using GE Intelligent Platform&#x27;s CIMPLICITY HMI solution suite.   We have observed this team utilizing .cim and .bcl files as attack vectors, both of which file types are used by the CIMPLICITY software.  As further proof of the malware targeting CIMPILICITY, it drops files into the CIMPLICITY installation directory using the %CIMPATH% environment variable on the victim machines. // Refs.: http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/sandworm-to-blacken-the-scada-connection/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/96695282962659462443629.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: Operation Potao Express // Description: ESET presented our initial findings based on research into the Win32/Potao malware family in June, in our CCCC 2015 presentation in Copenhagen. Today, we are releasing the full whitepaper on the Potao malware with additional findings, the cyberespionage campaigns where it was employed, and its connection to a backdoor in the form of a modified version of the TrueCrypt encryption software.Like BlackEnergy, the malware used by the so-called Sandworm APT group (also known as Quedagh), Potao is an example of targeted espionage malware directed mostly at targets in Ukraine and a number of other post-Soviet countries, including Russia, Georgia and Belarus. // Refs.: http://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Operation-Potao-Express_final_v2.pdf , https://github.com/eset/malware-ioc/tree/master/potao // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/666982922222383994254354546.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: New wave of cyberattacks against Ukrainian power industry // Description: The cyberattacks against the Ukrainian electric power industry continue. Yesterday (January 19th) we discovered a new wave of these attacks, where a number of electricity distribution companies in Ukraine were targeted again following the power outages in December. What&#x27;s particularly interesting is that the malware that was used this time is not BlackEnergy, which poses further questions about the perpetrators behind the ongoing operation. The malware is based on a freely-available open-source backdoor - something no one would expect from an alleged state-sponsored malware operator. // Refs.: http://www.welivesecurity.com/2016/01/20/new-wave-attacks-ukrainian-power-industry // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/5536436394539966263599325335494338499.json</div>

In fact, our team considers them some of the best adversaries out of all the numerous nation-state, criminal and hacktivist/terrorist groups we encounter on a daily basis. In particular, we identified advanced methods consistent with nation-state level capabilities including deliberate targeting and &#x27;access management&#x27; tradecraft - both groups were constantly going back into the environment to change out their implants, modify persistent methods, move to new Command &amp;amp; Control channels and perform other tasks to try to stay ahead of being detected. // Refs.: https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/bears-midst-intrusion-democratic-national-committee/ , https://www.threatconnect.com/tapping-into-democratic-national-committee/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/525554348646329633358839.json</div>
