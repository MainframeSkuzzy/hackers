<div id='otxpost'> Name: FIN7 Evolution and the Phishing LNK // Description: FIN7 is a financially-motivated threat group that has been associated with malicious operations dating back to late 2015. FIN7 is referred to by many vendors as &quot;Carbanak Group&quot;, although we do not equate all usage of the CARBANAK backdoor with FIN7. FireEye recently observed a FIN7 spear phishing campaign targeting personnel involved with United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings at various organizations.In a newly-identified campaign, FIN7 modified their phishing techniques to implement unique infection and persistence mechanisms. FIN7 has moved away from weaponized Microsoft Office macros in order to evade detection. This round of FIN7 phishing lures implements hidden shortcut files (LNK files) to initiate the infection and VBScript functionality launched by mshta.exe to infect the victim. // Refs.: https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/04/fin7-phishing-lnk.html // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/8822263824938685835393425692649.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: Spear Phishing attacks hits industrial companies // Description: Kaspersky Lab ICS CERT detected a targeted attack aimed at industrial organizations which began in August 2016 and is currently ongoing. The worst affected were companies in the smelting, electric power generation and transmission, construction, and engineering industries. Most of the organizations attacked were vendors of industrial automation solutions and system support contractors. In other words, the attack targeted organizations that design, build and support industrial solutions for critical infrastructure. Based on the data we have acquired since October 2016, about 500 organizations from 50 countries were affected by the attack.The emails had subject lines that were intended to convince unsuspecting recipients that they were from a legitimate source. Examples included fake commercial suppliers or shipping companies sending an updated price list, banks asking customers to validate banking information, or confirmation of equipment delivery. // Refs.: https://ics-cert.kaspersky.com/2016/12/16/spear-phishing-attack-hits-industrial-companies/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/58254988569356485298895.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: BBSRAT Attacks Targeting Russian Organizations // Description: In late 2014, ESET presented an attack campaign that had been observed over a period of time targeting Russia and other Russian speaking nations, dubbed &quot;Roaming Tiger&quot;. The attack was found to heavily rely on RTF exploits and at the time, thought to make use of the PlugX malware family.ESET did not attribute the attacks to a particular attack group, but noted that the objective of the campaign was espionage and general information stealing. The adversaries behind these attacks continued to target Russia and other Russian speaking nations using similar exploits and attack vectors. However, while the malware used in these new attacks uses similar infection mechanisms to PlugX, it is a completely new tool with its own specific behavior patterns and architecture. We have named this tool &quot;BBSRAT.&quot; // Refs.: http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2015/12/bbsrat-attacks-targeting-russian-organizations-linked-to-roaming-tiger/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/266533959852542339258669235285.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: Carbon Paper: Peering into Turlas second stage backdoor // Description: The Turla espionage group has been targeting various institutions for many years. Recently, we found several new versions of Carbon, a second stage backdoor in the Turla group arsenal. Last year, a technical analysis of this component was made by Swiss GovCERT.ch as part of their report detailing the attack that a defense firm owned by the Swiss government, RUAG, suffered in the past.This blog post highlights the technical innovations that we found in the latest versions of Carbon we have discovered. // Refs.: https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/03/30/carbon-paper-peering-turlas-second-stage-backdoor/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/634434268653998585985496.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: Pokemon-themed Umbreon Linux Rootkit Hits x86, ARM Systems // Description: The Trend Micro Forward Looking Threat Research team recently obtained samples of a new rootkit family from one of our trusted partners. We are providing a detailed analysis of the rootkit, and also making the samples available to the industry to help others block this threat.This rootkit family called Umbreon (sharing the same name as the Pokemon) targets Linux systems, including systems running both Intel and ARM processors, expanding the scope of this threat to include embedded devices as well. (An aside: the rootkit does appear to be named after the Pokemon of the same name. This Pokemon is known for hiding in the night, which is an appropriate characteristic for a rootkit.) We detect Umbreon under the ELF_UMBREON family. // Refs.: http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/pokemon-themed-umbreon-linux-rootkit-hits-x86-arm-systems/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/548848659846585858943849663648.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: BAIJIU: New Malware Abuses Popular Japanese Web Hosting Service // Description: BAIJIU&#x27;s goal in this attack was to deploy a set of espionage tools through a downloader we call TYPHOON and a set of backdoors we call LIONROCK.Three distinctive elements of BAIJIU drew and held our attention: the unusual complexity of the attack; the appropriation of web hosting service GeoCities (of 1990s fame); and the use of multiple methods of obfuscation. // Refs.: https://www.cylance.com/en_us/blog/baijiu.html // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/989425386633333654.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: EPS Processing Zero-Days Exploited by Multiple Threat Actors // Description: Recently, FireEye identified three new zero-day vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office products that are being exploited in the wild.At the end of March 2017, we detected another malicious document leveraging an unknown vulnerability in EPS and a recently patched vulnerability in Windows Graphics Device Interface (GDI) to drop malware. Following the April 2017 Patch Tuesday, in which Microsoft disabled EPS, FireEye detected a second unknown vulnerability in EPS.FireEye believes that two actors - Turla and an unknown financially motivated actor - were using the first EPS zero-day (CVE-2017-0261), and APT28 was using the second EPS zero-day (CVE-2017-0262) along with a new Escalation of Privilege (EOP) zero-day (CVE-2017-0263). Turla and APT28 are Russian cyber espionage groups that have used these zero-days against European diplomatic and military entities. The unidentified financial group targeted regional and global banks with offices in the Middle East. // Refs.: https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/05/eps-processing-zero-days.html , https://repo.quicksand.io/ef783cc3c4e1e0649b4629f3396cff4c0e0e0e67c07cacb8a9ae7c0cfa16bf0c.html , https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/sample/6785e29698444243677300db6a0c519909ae9e620d575e76d9be4862b33ed490?environmentId=100 , https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/sample/91acb0d56771af0196e34ac95194b3d0bf3200bc5f6208caf3a91286958876f9?environmentId=100 , https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2017-0262 , https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2017-0261 , https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/05/09/sednit-adds-two-zero-day-exploits-using-trumps-attack-syria-decoy/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/238488234225548253425969422964.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: Malspam Targeting Brazil Continues to Evolve // Description: For years now, criminals behind banking Trojans, remote access tools (RATs) and other types of malware have targeted Microsoft Windows hosts in Brazil through malicious spam (malspam). Antivirus often detects the associated malware as &quot;Banload,&quot; a family of Trojans that downloads other malware. We&#x27;ve identified 9,215 samples tagged &quot;Banload&quot; in AutoFocus since December 2013. Of these Banload samples, we&#x27;ve seen 2,132 samples during the first six months of 2017. // Refs.: https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2017/07/unit42-malspam-targeting-brazil-continues-evolve/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/8235686865428289465363695256622.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: Industroyer Biggest threat to industrial control systems since Stuxnet // Description: The 2016 attack on Ukraine&#x27;s power grid that deprived part of its capital, Kiev, of power for an hour was caused by a cyberattack. ESET researchers have since analyzed samples of malware, detected by ESET as Win32/Industroyer, capable of performing exactly that type of attack. // Refs.: https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Win32_Industroyer.pdf , https://dragos.com/blog/crashoverride/CrashOverride-01.pdf // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/426984586948264264653954624.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: SPEAR: A Threat Actor Resurfaces // Description: Several months ago I examined a malware-tainted Word document titled &quot;ISIS_twitter_list.doc.&quot; I didn&#x27;t think much of it and quickly moved on after a cursory analysis. Yet I recently uncovered evidence that suggests it was the work of a well-known Chinese threat group. This group is known to have targeted U.S. government agencies, defense contractors, aerospace firms and foreign militaries since 2009. Until now, it was widely believed the actor&#x27;s activities had largely subsided in 2013, following numerous public disclosures and detailed analyses of their backdoors. // Refs.: http://blog.cylance.com/spear-a-threat-actor-resurfaces // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/28648228695362226382642986368533263.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: FastPOS Updates in Time for the Retail Sale Season // Description: Most point-of-sale (PoS) threats follow a common process: dump, scrape, store, exfiltrate. FastPOS (initially detected by Trend Micro as TSPY_FASTPOS.SMZTDA) was different with the way it removed a middleman and went straight from stealing credit card data to directly exfiltrating them to its command and control (C&amp;amp;C) servers.FastPOS was true to its moniker--pilfer data as fast as possible, as much as it can, even at the expense of stealth. The malware is a reflection of how PoS threats, though no longer novel, are increasingly used against businesses and their customers. As such, FastPOS&#x27;s update does not come as a surprise--in time for the oncoming retail season to boot. // Refs.: http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/fastpos-updates-in-time-for-retail-sale-season/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/535359264226654683544862864339446965.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: Peering into GlassRAT // Description: Today RSA is reporting GlassRAT, a previously undetectable Remote Access Tool (RAT) which was discovered by the RSA Incident Response Team and investigated by RSA Research during an engagement with a multi-national enterprise.   While the malware was not detectable by endpoint antivirus products, RSA Security Analytics was able to identify and alert on its network traffic, and RSA ECAT subsequently identified the malware.Evidence suggests that the tool is being used as part of a very targeted campaign, focused on Chinese nationals in commercial organizations.GlassRAT&#x27;s command and control structure has exhibited brief overlap with C2 that was identified in campaigns associated with malware originally reported in 2012 that targeted government and military organizations in the Pacific Region. // Refs.: https://blogs.rsa.com/peering-into-glassrat/ , https://blogs.rsa.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/GlassRAT-final.pdf // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/2992622458688834625444433642.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: The EyePyramid attacks // Description: On January 10, 2017, a court order was declassified by the Italian police, in regards to a chain of cyberattacks directed at top Italian government members and institutions.The attacks leveraged a malware named &quot;EyePyramid&quot; to target a dozen politicians, bankers, prominent freemasons and law enforcement personalities in Italy. These included Fabrizio Saccomanni, the former deputy governor of the Bank of Italy, Piero Fassino, the former mayor of Turin, several members of a Masonic lodge, Matteo Renzi, former prime minister of Italy and Mario Draghi, another former prime minister of Italy and now president of the European Central Bank.The malware was spread using spear-phishing emails and the level of sophistication is low.

<div id='otxpost'> Name: Shamoon is back // Description: In August 2012, an attack campaign known as Shamoon targeted a Saudi Arabian energy company to deliver a malware called Disttrack. Disttrack is a multipurpose tool that exhibits worm-like behavior by attempting to spread to other systems on a local network using stolen administrator credentials. More importantly, its claim to fame is the ability to destroy data and to render infected systems unusable. The attack four years ago resulted in 30,000 or more systems being damaged.Last week, Unit 42 came across new Disttrack samples that appear to have been used in an updated attack campaign. The attack targeted at least one organization in Saudi Arabia, which aligns with the targeting of the initial Shamoon attacks. It appears the purpose of the new Disttrack samples were solely focused on destruction, as the samples were configured with a non-operational C2 server to report to and were set to begin wiping data exactly on 2016/11/17 20:45. // Refs.: http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/11/unit42-shamoon-2-return-disttrack-wiper/ , https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2016/11/fireeye_respondsto.html , https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/shamoon-back-dead-and-destructive-ever , https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/mcafee-labs/shamoon-rebooted/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/699822685883642864.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: From Shamoon to StoneDrill // Description: Beginning in November 2016, Kaspersky Lab observed a new wave of wiper attacks directed at multiple targets in the Middle East. The malware used in the new attacks was a variant of the infamous Shamoon worm that targeted Saudi Aramco and Rasgas back in 2012.Also known as Disttrack, Shamoon is a highly destructive malware family that effectively wipes the victim machine. A group known as the Cutting Sword of Justice took credit for the Saudi Aramco attack by posting a Pastebin message on the day of the attack (back in 2012), and justified the attack as a measure against the Saudi monarchy. // Refs.: https://securelist.com/blog/research/77725/from-shamoon-to-stonedrill/ , https://securelist.com/files/2017/03/Report_Shamoon_StoneDrill_final.pdf // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/6546393358833838985.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: Tofsee - modular spambot // Description: Tofsee, also known as Gheg, is another botnet analyzed by CERT Polska. Its main job is to send spam, but it is able to do other tasks as well. It is possible thanks to the modular design of this malware - it consists of the main binary (the one user downloads and infects with), which later downloads several additional modules from the C2 server - they modify code by overwriting some of the called functions with their own. An example of some actions these modules perform is spreading by posting click-bait messages on Facebook and VKontakte (Russian social network).Bot communicates with the botmaster using non-standard protocol built on top of TCP. The first message after establishing the connection is always sent by the server - the most important thing it contains is a random 128-byte key used for encrypting further communication. It is therefore impossible to decode the communication if one wasn&#x27;t listening right from its beginning. // Refs.: https://www.cert.pl/en/news/single/tofsee-en/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/48456369699964994565862532.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: Shell Crew Variant StreamEx // Description: Shell Crew, first named by RSA, has been incredibly proficient over time and breached numerous high-value targets. The backdoor provided an alternative foothold in several observed instances for the group and employed a few tricks like using the Intel SSE extended instruction set to avoid emulation and obscure analysis. The StreamEx family has the ability to access and modify the user&#x27;s file system, modify the registry, create system services, enumerate process and system information, enumerate network resources and drive types, scan for security tools such as firewall products and antivirus products, change browser security settings, and remotely execute commands.

<div id='otxpost'> Name: Operation Iron Tiger // Description: Key individuals, who are believed to be part of a China-based attack group, have been stealing years of valuable government and corporate information from defense and high technology organizations in the US since 2013 and political and government-related entities in China, Hong Kong, and the Philippines since 2010.This shift in targets is highly notable for the active cyber espionage operation we dubbed as &quot;Operation Iron Tiger.&quot; We believe that the threat actors have simply moved up in the food chain and were assigned new, high-level targets to spy on-all as part of a bigger espionage campaign.US defense contractors were only fairly recent targets based on the operation&#x27;s history, which we traced to spear-phishing in 2010. &quot;Foreign policy,&quot; &quot;future of the US Army Officer Corps,&quot; and &quot;economic development&quot; are only a few of the keywords that threat actors have been using in spear-phishing attacks against directors and project managers of technology-inclined US government contractors. // Refs.: http://www.trendmicro.com/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/white-papers/wp-operation-iron-tiger.pdf , http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/operation-iron-tiger-how-china-based-actors-shifted-attacks-from-apac-to-us-targets/ , http://documents.trendmicro.com/assets/pdf/operation-iron-tiger-appendix.pdf // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/385644988289484829455238942242.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: Operation Molerats: Middle East Cyber Attacks Using Poison Ivy // Description: In October 2012, malware attacks against Israeli government targets grabbed media attention as officials temporarily cut off Internet access for its entire police force and banned the use of USB memory sticks. [1] Security researchers subsequently linked these attacks to a broader, yearlong campaign that targeted not just Israelis but Palestinians as well. [2] -- and as discovered later, even the U.S. and UK governments.

<div id='otxpost'> Name: VB Dropper and Shellcode for Hancitor Reveal New Techniques Behind Uptick // Description: The Hancitor downloader has been relatively quiet since a major campaign back in June 2016. But over the past week, while performing research using Palo Alto Networks AutoFocus, we noticed a large uptick in the delivery of the Hancitor malware family as they shifted away from H1N1 to distribute Pony and Vawtrak executables. In parallel, we received reports from other firms and security researchers seeing similar activity, which pushed us to look into this further.The delivery method for these documents remained consistent to other common malicious e-mail campaigns. Lures contained subjects related to recent invoices, or other matters requiring the victim&#x27;s attention, such as an overdue bill. These lures were expected, until we started digging into the actual documents attached and saw an interesting method within the Visual Basic (VB) macros in the attached documents used for dropping the malware. // Refs.: http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/08/unit42-vb-dropper-and-shellcode-for-hancitor-reveal-new-techniques-behind-uptick/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/668938529923554826623266295439.json</div>

SPEAR was able to identify just over three hundred unique victims over the past month, as well as over 100GB worth of data that was exfiltrated and stored on one of the C2 servers. The bulk of the victims were predominantly based out of Ecuador, Venezuela, Peru, Argentina, and Columbia; however, other victims were identified in Korea, the United States, the Dominican Republic, Cuba, Bolivia, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Mexico, England, Canada, Germany, Russia, and Ukraine. Targets included a wide array of high-profile entities, including intelligence services, military, utility providers (telecommunications and power), embassies, and government institutions. // Refs.: https://www.cylance.com/en_us/blog/el-machete-malware-attacks-cut-through-latam.html , https://securelist.com/blog/research/66108/el-machete/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/59262592394242925588525583.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: Privileges and Credentials: Phished at the Request of Counsel // Description: In May and June 2017, FireEye observed a phishing campaign targeting at least seven global law and investment firms. We have associated this campaign with APT19, a group that we assess is composed of freelancers, with some degree of sponsorship by the Chinese government.APT19 used three different techniques to attempt to compromise targets. In early May, the phishing lures leveraged RTF attachments that exploited the Microsoft Windows vulnerability described in CVE 2017-0199. Toward the end of May, APT19 switched to using macro-enabled Microsoft Excel (XLSM) documents. In the most recent versions, APT19 added an application whitelisting bypass to the macro-enabled Microsoft Excel (XLSM) documents. At least one observed phishing lure delivered a Cobalt Strike payload. // Refs.: https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/06/phished-at-the-request-of-counsel.html // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/429599282999689956863384832.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: OSX/Dok - OSX Malware // Description: This new malware - dubbed OSX/Dok -- affects all versions of OSX, has 0 detections on VirusTotal (as of the writing of these words), is signed with a valid developer certificate (authenticated by Apple), and is the first major scale malware to target OSX users via a coordinated email phishing campaign.Once OSX/Dok infection is complete, the attackers gain complete access to all victim communication, including communication encrypted by SSL. This is done by redirecting victim traffic through a malicious proxy server. The malware mostly targets European users. // Refs.: http://blog.checkpoint.com/2017/04/27/osx-malware-catching-wants-read-https-traffic/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/42328224464554324943256986968685.json</div>
