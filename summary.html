<div id='otxpost'> Name: Investigation of Linux.Mirai Trojan family // Description: A Trojan for Linux that was named Linux.Mirai has several predecessors. The first malware program belongingto this family was spotted in May 2016 and was dubbed Linux.DDoS.87. At the beginning ofAugust, a new version of this Trojan--Linux.DDoS.89--was discovered. Finally, Doctor Web&#x27;s securityresearchers investigated the Linux.Mirai Trojan found later that month. // Refs.: https://st.drweb.com/static/new-www/news/2016/september/Investigation_of_Linux.Mirai_Trojan_family_en.pdf // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/49342434236653822299442856282.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: New Attacks Linked to C0d0s0 Group // Description: Unit 42 discovered new activity that appears related to an adversary group previously called &quot;C0d0so0&quot; or &quot;Codoso&quot;. This group is well known for a widely publicized attack involving the compromise of Forbes.com, in which the site was used to compromise selected targets via a watering hole to a zero-day Adobe Flash exploit. Compared to other adversary groups, C0d0so0 has shown the use of more sophisticated tactics and tools and has been linked to leveraging zero-day exploits on numerous occasions in combination with watering hole and spear phishing attacks.In the newly discovered attack campaign, Unit 42 identified attacks targeting organizations within the telecommunications, high tech, education, manufacturing, and legal services industries. The attacks likely were initially delivered via spear-phishing e-mails, or as demonstrated by C0d0so0 in the past, legitimate websites that had been previously compromised then used as watering holes for the selected victims. // Refs.: http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/01/new-attacks-linked-to-c0d0s0-group/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/6658966649626494655592296926.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: An analysis of exploit supply chains and digital quartermasters // Description: On July 5, 2015 an unknown hacker publicly announced on Twitter that he had breached the internal network of Hacking Team - an Italian pentesting company known to purchase 0-day exploits and produce their own trojans. The hacker proceeded to leak archives of internal Hacking Team tools and communications. A number of tools and previously unknown exploits were discovered in the trove of data posted online. In the attached paper we will focus on two exploits which at the time of discovery in the Hacking Team archives were unpatched. The two 0-days in question targeted Adobe Flash and were subsequently labeled CVE-2015-5119 and CVE-2015-5122. // Refs.: http://blog.shadowserver.org/2015/08/10/the-italian-connection-an-analysis-of-exploit-supply-chains-and-digital-quartermasters/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/2459384466893668343636262925598242693524.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: The return of HackingTeam with new implants for OS X // Description: Last week, Patrick Wardle published a very nice analysis of a new Backdoor and Dropper used by HackingTeam, which is apparently alive and well. Since HackingTeam implants are built on-demand for each target, we wanted to take a closer look: to see how it works and what its functionality reveals about the possible interest of the attackers behind this latest Backdoor. // Refs.: https://securelist.com/blog/research/74063/the-return-of-hackingteam-with-new-implants-for-os-x/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/5283824492658944955946439234936.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: Wild Neutron - Economic espionage threat actor returns // Description: A powerful threat actor known as &quot;Wild Neutron&quot; (also known as &quot;Jripbot&quot; and &quot;Morpho&quot;) has been active since at least 2011, infecting high profile companies for several years by using a combination of exploits, watering holes and multi-platform malware.The latest round of attacks in 2015 uses a stolen code signing certificate belonging to Taiwanese electronics maker Acer and an unknown Flash Player exploit.Wild Neutron hit the spotlight in 2013, when it successfully infected companies such as Apple, Facebook, Twitter and Microsoft. This attack took advantage of a Java zero-day exploit and used hacked forums as watering holes. The 2013 incident was highly publicized and, in the aftermath, the threat actor went dark for almost one year. // Refs.: https://securelist.com/blog/research/71275/wild-neutron-economic-espionage-threat-actor-returns-with-new-tricks/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/6559448495634393264424654865445.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: Ostap Bender: 400 Ways to Make the Population Part With Their Money // Description: In late October, Proofpoint researchers identified and began tracking a financially-motivated threat actor group with access to banking Trojans and other malware, including Dridex, Ursnif, Tinba, and the point-of-sale (POS) malware AbaddonPOS with its loader, TinyLoader. More significantly, the group also uses a previously undocumented JScript backdoor called &quot;Ostap&quot; and a Delphi dropper we named &quot;MrWhite&quot;. MrWhite can profile the victim systems for the presence of running POS software before dropping further POS payloads. Adding this extra layer of filtering may help the group focus on targets of interest and evade detection due to use of known malware.So far, these campaigns have targeted countries including Germany, Austria, and the United Kingdom. While vertical targeting varies, we observed a significant focus on Financial Services. // Refs.: https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/ostap-bender-400-ways-make-population-part-with-their-money // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/96452588564464258688.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: Real News, Fake Flash Mac OS X Users Targeted // Description: Volexity recently identified a breach to the website of a well regarded media outlet in the country of Georgia. As part of this breach, the media organization&#x27;s website was being leveraged as a component of a malware campaign targeting select visitors. The news organization provides reporting on its website in English, Georgian, and Russian. However, only the Georgian language portion of the website was impacted and used in an effort to distribute malware. The targets were then further narrowed to those that were running the Mac OS X operating system, had not previously visited the website, and had specific browser versions. The attackers accomplished much of this with JavaScript they placed on the media organization&#x27;s website. // Refs.: https://www.volexity.com/blog/2017/07/24/real-news-fake-flash-mac-os-x-users-targeted/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/2399323368999669235654898.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: XAgentOSX: Sofacys XAgent macOS Tool // Description: During our continued research on Sofacy&#x27;s Komplex Trojan, we have found a sample of a backdoor Trojan that we believe the Sofacy group uses when targeting individuals running macOS systems. The backdoor Trojan authors have called it XAgentOSX, which shares the name XAgent with one of Sofacy&#x27;s Windows-based Trojan and references Apple&#x27;s previous name for macOS, OS X. It appears the same actor developed both the Komplex and XAgentOSX tools, based on similarities within the following project paths found within the tools. // Refs.: http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2017/02/unit42-xagentosx-sofacys-xagent-macos-tool/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/56655324385584953558828564385224.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: Threat Group-3390 Targets Organizations for Cyberespionage // Description: Dell SecureWorks Counter Threat Unit(TM) (CTU) researchers investigated activities associated with Threat Group-3390[1] (TG-3390). Analysis of TG-3390&#x27;s operations, targeting, and tools led CTU researchers to assess with moderate confidence the group is located in the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The threat actors target a wide range of organizations: CTU researchers have observed TG-3390 actors obtaining confidential data on defense manufacturing projects, but also targeting other industry verticals and attacking organizations involved in international relations. The group extensively uses long-running strategic web compromises[2] (SWCs), and relies on whitelists to deliver payloads to select victims. In comparison to other threat groups, TG-3390 is notable for its tendency to compromise Microsoft Exchange servers using a custom backdoor and credential logger. // Refs.: http://www.secureworks.com/cyber-threat-intelligence/threats/threat-group-3390-targets-organizations-for-cyberespionage/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/53623326955238425934369326.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: Android trojan drops in, despite Google Bouncer // Description: We at ESET recently discovered an interesting stealth attack on Android users, an app that is a regular game but with one interesting addition: the application was bundled with another application with the name systemdata or resourcea and that&#x27;s certainly a bit fishy. Why would a regular game downloaded from the official Google Play store come with another application named systemdata? This particular application/game from Google Play Store is certainly not a system application, as the name seems intended to suggest.The packaged application is dropped silently onto the device but has to ask the user to actually install it. The app requesting the installation is passed off as a &#x27;Manage Settings&#x27; app. After installation, the application runs in the background as service.ESET detects the games that install the Trojan as Android/TrojanDropper.Mapin and the Trojan itself as Android/Mapin. // Refs.: http://www.welivesecurity.com/2015/09/22/android-trojan-drops-in-despite-googles-bouncer/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/352442389268282398499869528.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: Terracotta VPN: Enabler of Advanced Threat Anonymity // Description: Today, RSA Research published an in-depth report on a commercial VPN network, originating in China, which we are calling &quot;Terracotta&quot;.  It is being used as a launch platform for APT actors including the now well-known Shell_Crew / Deep Panda group.Terracotta&#x27;s network of 1500+ VPN nodes throughout the world are primarily obtained by hacking into inadequately protected Windows servers in legitimate organizations, without the victim&#x27;s knowledge or permission.  New nodes are continually added as new victims are enlisted, and they are unpublished outside of the Terracotta user-base. // Refs.: https://blogs.rsa.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Terracotta-VPN-Report-Final-8-3.pdf // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/45835458439582866845634244.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: Similarities Between Carbanak and FIN7 Malware Suggest Actors Are Closely Related // Description: Several days ago, researchers at FireEye attributed a recent phishing campaign to FIN7, a campaign in which cybercriminals delivered malicious Microsoft Office documents to users, deploying both Cobalt Strike and a VBS-based backdoor on infected workstations. This report contained a sentence of particular interest to Cyber4Sight: &quot;FIN7 is referred to by many vendors as &#x27;Carbanak Group,&#x27; although we do not equate all usage of the Carbanak backdoor with FIN7.&quot; In their previous report on this threat actor group, FireEye stopped short of making this direct connection, stating instead that &quot;The use of the CARBANAK malware in FIN7 operations also provides limited evidence that these campaigns are linked to previously observed CARBANAK operations leading to fraudulent banking transactions, ATM compromise, and other monetization schemes.&quot; // Refs.: https://blog.cyber4sight.com/2017/04/similarities-between-carbanak-and-fin7-malware-suggest-actors-are-closely-related/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/884683224848929569989426993583.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: New activity of the Blue Termite APT // Description: In October 2014, Kaspersky Lab started to research &quot;Blue Termite&quot;, an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) targeting Japan. The oldest sample we&#x27;ve seen up to now is from November 2013. This is not the first time the country has been a victim of an APT. However, the attack is different in two respects: unlike other APTs, the main focus of Blue Termite is to attack Japanese organizations; and most of their C2s are located in Japan. One of the top targets is the Japan Pension Service, but the list of targeted industries includes government and government agencies, local governments, public interest groups, universities, banks, financial services, energy, communication, heavy industry, chemical, automotive, electrical, news media, information services sector, health care, real estate, food, semiconductor, robotics, construction, insurance, transportation and so on. Unfortunately, the attack is still active and the number of victims has been increasing. // Refs.: https://securelist.com/blog/research/71876/new-activity-of-the-blue-termite-apt/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/4222535834368264624862984846245243.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: Exploring Bergard: Old Malware with New Tricks // Description: The Bergard Trojan and the C0d0so group that made it famous with the November 2014 watering hole attack [1] via Forbes.com have received renewed attention recently, with other researchers [2] potentially linking emerging tools and recent attacks to the group. Proofpoint researchers conducted a historical analysis of samples related to this research and uncovered new malware variants and likely origins and methods of infection. Many of these samples have not been discussed publicly and several have very little or no anti-virus coverage. The analysis that follows is of completed, historical attacks as well as an extremely recent and ongoing attack, providing insight into the volume and timeline of infections, as well as a timeline for attacker-initiated actions using a novel malware family. // Refs.: https://www.proofpoint.com/us/exploring-bergard-old-malware-new-tricks // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/3456558629956863553633888.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: Tomcat IR with XOR.DDoS // Description: Apache Tomcat is a java based web service that is used for different applications. While you may have it running in your environment, you may not be familiar with its workings to provide adequate incident response  when the time come. This article will walk through an incident where Tomcat is used and what critical artifacts you should collect. // Refs.: https://isc.sans.edu/diary/Tomcat+IR+with+XOR.DDoS/20721 // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/883536584654424989223895.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: Grabit and the RATs // Description: Not so long ago, Kaspersky clients in the United States approached Kaspersky researchers with a request to investigate a new type of malicious software that they were able to recover from their organizations&#x27; servers. The malware calls itself Grabit and is distinctive because of its versatile behavior. Every sample we found was different in size and activity from the others but the internal name and other identifiers were disturbingly similar. The timestamp seems valid and close to the documented infection timeline. Our documentation points to a campaign that started somewhere in late February 2015 and ended in mid-March. As the development phase supposedly ended, malware started spreading from India, the United States and Israel to other countries around the globe. // Refs.: https://securelist.com/blog/research/70087/grabit-and-the-rats/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/9868344422858499528425839.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: Orcus - Birth of an unusual plugin builder RAT // Description: Unit 42 has been tracking a new Remote Access Trojan (RAT) being sold for $40 USD since April 2016, known as &quot;Orcus&quot;. Though Orcus has all the typical features of RAT malware, it allows users to build custom plugins and also has a modular architecture for better management and scalability. The objective of this blog is to highlight some of the capabilities of this new RAT family and the impact seen so far. // Refs.: http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/08/unit42-orcus-birth-of-an-unusual-plugin-builder-rat/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/955234956843258359295495223.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: NetTraveler APT Targets Russian, European Interests // Description: Throughout 2016, Proofpoint researchers tracked a cyber-espionage campaign targeting victims in Russia and neighboring countries. The actor utilizes spear phishing campaigns to deliver NetTraveler, also known as TravNet. First observed as early as 2004, NetTraveler is a Trojan used widely in targeted attacks. We believe that this attacker operates out of China. In addition to Russia, targeted regions include neighboring countries such as Mongolia, Belarus, and other European countries. The spear-phishing campaigns we detected use links to RAR-compressed executables and Microsoft Word attachments that exploit the CVE-2012-0158 vulnerability.This particular APT is targeting organizations that include weapons manufacturers, human rights activists, and pro-democracy groups, among others. // Refs.: https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/nettraveler-apt-targets-russian-european-interests // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/93428453553929869223833388532542.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: Hellsing APT // Description: The Hellsing APT group is currently active in the APAC region, hitting targets mainly in the South China Sea area, with a focus on Malaysia, the Philippines and Indonesia. The group has a relatively small footprint compared to massive operations such as &quot;Equation&quot;. Smaller groups can have the advantage of being able to stay under the radar for longer periods of time, which is what happened here. // Refs.: https://securelist.com/analysis/publications/69567/the-chronicles-of-the-hellsing-apt-the-empire-strikes-back/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/8494838486854462393564289243569.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: Defaulting on Passwords (Part 1): r0_bot // Description: Early in March, while studying the ChinaZ threat, it became readily apparent that default passwords were being used for more than just a supplementary attack vector. Several bots relied heavily, if not exclusively, on systems with weak and/or default passwords to spread. We setup a system with weak and default passwords to capture any and all malware spread in this fashion. For this first test, I selected 5 sets of passwords; admin/admin, guest/guest, ubnt/ubnt, cisco/cisco and ADMIN/ADMIN (the last for picking up folks scanning for Supermicro IPMI devices). Unsurprisingly, it took just under 3 hours for the first infection to hit. What did surprise us though was what password combination was first to be hit; ubnt/ubnt. // Refs.: http://blog.cari.net/carisirt-defaulting-on-passwords-part-1-r0_bot/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/3943894899845533633699226.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: MajikPOS Combines PoS Malware and RATs to Pull Off its Malicious Tricks // Description: Crooks behind MajikPOS have various tricks up their sleeves. Apart from infecting systems withit, we also spotted instances where common lateral movement tools were detected around thesame time they were actively compromising the endpoint with MajikPOS. These tools include:HKTL_MIMIKATZ, HKTL_FGDUMP, and HKTL_VNCPASSVIEW. We surmise that the badguys attempted to gain further access within the victim&#x27;s network. In separate isolated incidents,we also noticed the deployment of MajikPOS via PsExec, a command-line tool that can be usedto remotely execute processes on other systems. This may indicate that valid, administrative levelcredentials were used against the host. The attackers also tend to deploy what works orwhat&amp;#39;s convenient, as we&#x27;ve also seen them attempt to infect the target host with other PoSmalware such as PwnPOS (TSPY_PWNPOS.SMA), and BlackPOS (TSPY_POCARDL.AI). // Refs.: http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/majikpos-combines-pos-malware-and-rats/ , https://documents.trendmicro.com/assets/majikpos-combines-pos-malware-and-rats-to-pull-off-its-malicious-tricks.pdf // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/4586839849638294986648224925.json</div>

Cybercriminals are using local brand names such as local ISP providers and legitimate looking addresses to fool users into downloading malware that can steal information by monitoring browsers, file transfer protocol (FTP) clients, and mail clients. Its targets? Mostly rural banks.BEBLOH is a banking Trojan that has been around since as early as 2009. It has outlived several competitors including Zeus, and SpyEye. It is designed to steal money from unsuspecting victims right off their bank accounts without them even noticing. BEBLOH always came up with new defensive measures to avoid AV products, and this time is no different. BEBLOH is also known for hiding in memory and creating a temporary new executable file upon shutdown, and deleting said file after re-infecting the system. // Refs.: http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/bebloh-expands-japan-latest-spam-attack/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/68486224394338484329936426634549.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: Odinaff: New Trojan used in high level financial attacks // Description: Since January 2016, discreet campaigns involving malware called Trojan.Odinaff have targeted a number of financial organizations worldwide. These attacks appear to be extremely focused on organizations operating in the banking, securities, trading, and payroll sectors. Organizations who provide support services to these industries are also of interest.Odinaff is typically deployed in the first stage of an attack, to gain a foothold onto the network, providing a persistent presence and the ability to install additional tools onto the target network. These additional tools bear the hallmarks of a sophisticated attacker which has plagued the financial industry since at least 2013-Carbanak. This new wave of attacks has also used some infrastructure that has previously been used in Carbanak campaigns. // Refs.: http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/odinaff-new-trojan-used-high-level-financial-attacks // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/6235636829392845823683649898546.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: Magic Hound Campaign Attacks Saudi Targets // Description: Unit 42 has discovered a persistent attack campaign operating primarily in the Middle East dating back to at least mid-2016 which we have named Magic Hound. This appears to be an attack campaign focused on espionage. Based upon our visibility it has primarily targeted organizations in the energy, government, and technology sectors that are either in in or business interests in Saudi Arabia. The adversaries appear to have evolved their tactics and techniques throughout the tracked time-period, iterating through a diverse toolset across different waves of attacks. Link analysis of infrastructure and tools also revealed a potential relationship between Magic Hound and the adversary group called &quot;Rocket Kitten&quot; (AKA Operation Saffron Rose, Ajax Security Team, Operation Woolen-Goldfish) as well as an older attack campaign called Newscasters. // Refs.: http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2017/02/unit42-magic-hound-campaign-attacks-saudi-targets/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/28968589956339392834584922.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: Carbanak gang is back and packing new guns // Description: The Carbanak financial APT group made the headlines when Group-IB and Fox-IT broke the news in December 2014, followed by the Kaspersky report in February 2015. The two reports describe the same cybercriminal gang which stole up to several hundreds of millions of dollars from various financial institutions.However, the story is interesting not only because of the large amount of money stolen but also from a technical point of view. The Carbanak team does not just blindly compromise large numbers of computers and try to &#x27;milk the cow&#x27; as other actors do, instead they act like a mature APT-group. They only compromise specific high-value targets and once inside the company networks, move laterally to hosts that can be monetized. // Refs.: http://www.welivesecurity.com/2015/09/08/carbanak-gang-is-back-and-packing-new-guns/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/52342689348539326463869.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: Sakula Malware Family // Description: Dell SecureWorks Counter Threat Unit(TM) (CTU) researchers analyzed multiple versions of a remote access trojan (RAT) named Sakula (also known as Sakurel and VIPER). The RAT, which according to compile timestamps first surfaced in November 2012, has been used in targeted intrusions through 2015. Sakula enables an adversary to run interactive commands as well as to download and execute additional components.Sakula uses HTTP GET and POST communication for command and control (C2). Network communication is obfuscated with single-byte XOR encoding. Sakula also leverages single-byte XOR encoding to obfuscate various strings and files embedded in the resource section, which are subsequently used for User Account Control (UAC) bypass on both 32 and 64-bit systems. Most samples maintain persistence through a registry Run key, although some samples configure themselves as a service. // Refs.: http://www.secureworks.com/cyber-threat-intelligence/threats/sakula-malware-family/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/29985543422244665963624252298254.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: Scarlet Mimic: Espionage Campaign Targets Minority Activists // Description: Over the past seven months, Unit 42 has been investigating a series of attacks we attribute to a group we have code named &quot;Scarlet Mimic.&quot; The attacks began over four years ago and their targeting pattern suggests that this adversary&#x27;s primary mission is to gather information about minority rights activists. We do not have evidence directly linking these attacks to a government source, but the information derived from these activities supports an assessment that a group or groups with motivations similar to the stated position of the Chinese government in relation to these targets is involved.The attacks we attribute to Scarlet Mimic have primarily targeted Uyghur and Tibetan activists as well as those who are interested in their causes. Both the Tibetan community and the Uyghurs, a Turkic Muslim minority residing primarily in northwest China, have been targets of multiple sophisticated attacks in the past decade. // Refs.: http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/01/scarlet-mimic-years-long-espionage-targets-minority-activists/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/5829648884664486662923482.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: Emissary Trojan/ Operation Lotus Blossom Update // Description: In December 2015, Unit 42 published a blog about a cyber espionage attack using the Emissary Trojan as a payload. Emissary is related to the Elise Trojan and the Operation Lotus Blossom attack campaign, which prompted us to start collecting additional samples of Emissary.The oldest sample we found was created in 2009, indicating this tool has been in use for almost seven years. Of note, this is three years earlier than the oldest Elise sample we have found, suggesting this group has been active longer than previously documented. In addition, Emissary appears to only be used against Taiwanese or Hong Kong based targets, all of the decoys are written in Traditional Chinese, and they use themes related to the government or military. // Refs.: http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/02/emissary-trojan-changelog-did-operation-lotus-blossom-cause-it-to-evolve/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/52498963295294343295865438499.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: Following the Trail of BlackTechs Cyber Espionage Campaigns // Description: BlackTech is a cyber espionage group operating against targets in East Asia, particularly Taiwan, and occasionally, Japan and Hong Kong. Based on the mutexes and domain names of some of their C&amp;amp;C servers, BlackTech&#x27;s campaigns are likely designed to steal their target&#x27;s technology.Following their activities and evolving tactics and techniques helped us uncover the proverbial red string of fate that connected three seemingly disparate campaigns: PLEAD, Shrouded Crossbow, and of late, Waterbear.Over the course of their campaigns, we analyzed their modus operandi and dissected their tools of the trade--and uncovered common denominators indicating that PLEAD, Shrouded Crossbow, and Waterbear may actually be operated by the same group. // Refs.: http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/following-trail-blacktech-cyber-espionage-campaigns/ , https://documents.trendmicro.com/assets/appendix-following-the-trail-of-blacktechs-cyber-espionage-campaigns.pdf , https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2017-062616-1123-99 // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/5466586955883469964628.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: Duke APT group&#x27;s latest tools: cloud services and Linux support // Description: Recent weeks have seen the outing of two new additions to the Duke group&#x27;s toolset, SeaDuke and CloudDuke. Of these, SeaDuke is a simple trojan made interesting by the fact that it&#x27;s written in Python. And even more curiously, SeaDuke, with its built-in support for both Windows and Linux, is the first cross-platform malware we have observed from the Duke group. While SeaDuke is a single - albeit cross-platform - trojan, CloudDuke appears to be an entire toolset of malware components, or &quot;solutions&quot; as the Duke group apparently calls them. These components include a unique loader, downloader, and not one but two different trojan components. CloudDuke also greatly expands on the Duke group&#x27;s usage of cloud storage services, specifically Microsoft&#x27;s OneDrive, as a channel for both command and control as well as the exfiltration of stolen data. Finally, some of the recent CloudDuke spear-phishing campaigns have born a striking resemblance to CozyDuke spear-phishing campaigns from a year ago. // Refs.: https://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/00002822.html // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/4262564432922264523685526493.json</div>

Looking closer at the structure of this attack, we were surprised when we realized this was the infamous Blackhole.Blackhole&#x27;s author, Paunch, was arrested in October 2013 and while criminals kept using the kit for the next few months, the exploits slowly deprecated and lost value because of lack of development.The new drive-by download attacks we caught over the weekend rely on the same structure as the original Blackhole, even reusing the old PDF and Java exploits. The only difference is the malware payload being dropped, which is current and had very low detection on VirusTotal. // Refs.: https://blog.malwarebytes.org/exploits-2/2015/11/blast-from-the-past-blackhole-exploit-kit-resurfaces-in-live-attacks/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/629584823634665489952464485243.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: Lurk: Retracing the Group&#x27;s Five-Year Campaign // Description: The cybercriminal group Lurk was one of the first to effectively employ fileless infection techniques in large-scale attacks--techniques that arguably became staples for other malefactors. A typical Lurk infection uses browser exploits to deliver non-persistent payloads to potential victims, probing their targets before deploying additional malware. The infection chain had multiple stages, and was accomplished using bodiless/fileless exploit payloads executed in-memory without additional persistence mechanisms. No traces were left on affected systems apart from files from the exploit process if the target machine wasn&#x27;t interesting to the Lurk operators. This eponymous lurking behavior would earn them notoriety until their operations were stymied and the perpetrators arrested. Lurk was believed to have siphoned over $45 million from financial organizations, ultimately disrupting the victims&#x27; operations, reputation, and bottom line. // Refs.: http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/lurk-retracing-five-year-campaign/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/894262334565986625844869396852.json</div>

In 2015, KOVTER, a click-fraud malware, made headlines when it used a file-less technique similar to the POWERLIKS trojan. The KOVTER malware embeds a JavaScript into the registry and executes a PowerShell script which eventually loads the main KOVTER binaries.

We call it the XM1RPC campaign due to the common backdoor used across all of the compromised sites.The file is named in such a way as to confuse WordPress administrators who are familiar with XML-RPC.  This malware usually infects all sites that share the same FTP account, which means cleaning just one website won&#x27;t help as hackers use the compromised site to reinfect all sites on the server in a matter of minutes. // Refs.: https://blog.sucuri.net/2016/11/xm1rpc-spam-backdoor.html // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/2249544894635232282669.json</div>

The group uses an advanced piece of malware known as Remsec (Backdoor.Remsec) to conduct its attacks. Remsec is a stealthy tool that appears to be primarily designed for spying purposes. Its code contains a reference to Sauron, the all-seeing antagonist in Lord of the Rings.Strider&#x27;s attacks have tentative links with a previously uncovered group, Flamer. The use of Lua modules, which we&#x27;ll discuss later, is a technique that has previously been used by Flamer.

<div id='otxpost'> Name: MARCHER GETS CLOSE TO USERS BY TARGETING MOBILE BANKING, ANDROID APPS, SOCIAL MEDIA, AND EMAIL // Description: Marcher inspects its infected devices carefully by using a dedicated, hard-coded configuration in each Android Package Kit (APK), Google&#x27;s file format for distributing and installing application software (like mobile banking apps) on the Android OS. Each APK has the ability to target different financial institutions in specific geographical locations.F5 research conducted in March 2017 followed 153 Marcher configuration files to uncover target and activity trends in the worldwide attack campaigns. Among the 153 configuration files, 54 distinct command and control (C&amp;amp;C) servers were detected. Of the 54 distinct C&amp;amp;C servers, 12 of them were online and operational (until F5 had them shut down in March), 10 were sink-holed, and 32 were already offline. The remaining 99 C&amp;amp;C servers were duplicated configurations from different APKs. This is likely due to configuration files being hardcoded within the APK, and old spam campaigns infecting different users, thus, old configurations still being detected in the wild. // Refs.: https://f5.com/labs/articles/threat-intelligence/malware/marcher-gets-close-to-users-by-targeting-mobile-banking-android-apps-social-media-and-email-26004 // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/862485458369946496288862439.json</div>

Currently, it is designed to collect data from PoS systems running on Oracle(r) MICROS(r), a platform popularly used in the hospitality, food and beverage, and retail industries.MalumPoS was designed to be configurable. This means that in the future, the threat actor can change or add other processes or targets. He can, for example, configure MalumPoS to include Radiant or NCR Counterpoint PoS systems to its target list. With that inclusion, companies running on those systems will also be at risk. // Refs.: http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/trend-micro-discovers-malumpos-targets-hotels-and-other-us-industries/ , http://documents.trendmicro.com/images/tex/pdf/MalumPOS%20Technical%20Brief.pdf // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/358849855326294236633495855.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: MALWARE POSING AS HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS AND COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE TARGETING IRANIANS AND FOREIGN POLICY INSTITUTIONS // Description: On August 4, 2016, the Gmail account of an unknown individual was compromised in order to conduct spearphishing campaigns against a diverse set of targets related to Iran. The spearphishing attempt posed as a message from the Director of United for Iran, a U.S.-based human rights organization, claiming that the organization had developed a secure communications tool for activists. The message was sent from an account created under her name on lesser known email provider (1&amp;amp;1&#x27;s Mail.com), a common tactic in recent months, with a link to a file hosted on Dropbox and an additional credential phishing attempt. Once the observed Gmail account was under their control, the actors then forwarded malware to over a hundred of their contacts, ranging from an address for the United Nations Refugee Agency in Turkey to a site contact for Reza Pahlavi, the son of the deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. // Refs.: https://iranthreats.github.io/resources/human-rights-impersonation-malware/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/438536325523956889.json</div>

However, Unit 42 has recently discovered the actors have continued to evolve their custom malware arsenal. We&#x27;ve discovered a new malware family we&#x27;ve named TidePool. It has strong behavioral ties to Ke3chang and is being used in an ongoing attack campaign against Indian embassy personnel worldwide. This targeting is also consistent with previous attacker TTPs; Ke3chang historically targeted the Ministry of Affairs, and also conducted several prior campaigns against India. // Refs.: http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/05/operation-ke3chang-resurfaces-with-new-tidepool-malware/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/52435952843935945946684398.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: T9000: Advanced Modular Backdoor Uses Complex Anti-Analysis // Description: Most custom backdoors used by advanced attackers have limited functionality. They evade detection by keeping their code simple and flying under the radar. But during a recent investigation we found a backdoor that takes a very different approach. We refer to this backdoor as T9000, which is a newer variant of the T5000 malware family, also known as Plat1.In addition to the basic functionality all backdoors provide, T9000 allows the attacker to capture encrypted data, take screenshots of specific applications and specifically target Skype users. The malware goes to great lengths to identify a total of 24 potential security products that may be running on a system and customizes its installation mechanism to specifically evade those that are installed. It uses a multi-stage installation process with specific checks at each point to identify if it is undergoing analysis by a security researcher.The primary functionality of this tool is to gather information about the victim. // Refs.: http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/02/t9000-advanced-modular-backdoor-uses-complex-anti-analysis-techniques/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/36389935983936293448232446229.json</div>

FastPOS (initially detected by Trend Micro as TSPY_FASTPOS.SMZTDA) was different with the way it removed a middleman and went straight from stealing credit card data to directly exfiltrating them to its command and control (C&amp;amp;C) servers.FastPOS was true to its moniker--pilfer data as fast as possible, as much as it can, even at the expense of stealth. The malware is a reflection of how PoS threats, though no longer novel, are increasingly used against businesses and their customers. As such, FastPOS&#x27;s update does not come as a surprise--in time for the oncoming retail season to boot. // Refs.: http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/fastpos-updates-in-time-for-retail-sale-season/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/535359264226654683544862864339446965.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: APT29 Domain Fronting With TOR // Description: Mandiant has observed Russian nation-state attackers APT29 employing domain fronting techniques for stealthy backdoor access to victim environments for at least two years. There has been considerable discussion about domain fronting following the release of a paper detailing these techniques. Domain fronting provides outbound network connections that are indistinguishable from legitimate requests for popular websites.APT29 has used The Onion Router (TOR) and the TOR domain fronting plugin meek to create a hidden, encrypted network tunnel that appeared to connect to Google services over TLS. This tunnel provided the attacker remote access to the host system using the Terminal Services (TS), NetBIOS, and Server Message Block (SMB) services, while appearing to be traffic to legitimate websites. The attackers also leveraged a common Windows exploit to access a privileged command shell without authenticating. // Refs.: https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/03/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/56265323853288386583389555869.json</div>

This new technique ensures that the payload/file remains in memory through its execution, never touching the disk in a de-encrypted state.  In doing so, the attacker can remain out of view from antivirus technologies, and even &#x27;next-generation&#x27; technologies that only focus on file-based threat vectors.  Also, the samples analyzed have the ability detect the presence of a virtual machine to ensure it&#x27;s not being analyzed in a network sandbox.And finally it&#x27;s important to highlight that the RAT itself is not new. // Refs.: https://www.sentinelone.com/blogs/teaching-an-old-rat-new-tricks/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/683263385648448865254264268.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: Moonlight - Targeted attacks in the Middle East // Description: Vectra Threat Labs researchers have uncovered the activities of a group of individuals currently engaged in targeted attacks against entities in the Middle East. We identified over two hundred samples of malware generated by the group over the last two years. These attacks are themed around Middle Eastern political issues and the motivation appears to relate to espionage, as opposed to opportunistic or criminal intentions.These are not technically sophisticated attackers. However, they do deploy some novel tactics, detailed below, and the implications of these attacks could be significant. Both the tools and targets of Moonlight are reminiscent of &quot;Gaza Hacker Team,&quot; a group of attackers that are said to be politically aligned to the Hamas[1]. In spite of these commonalities, we have not identified any firm links between the two groups.We refer to this group of attackers as Moonlight, after the name the attackers chose for one of their command-and-control domains. // Refs.: http://blog.vectranetworks.com/blog/moonlight-middle-east-targeted-attacks // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/649986383658884292696.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: Flying Dragon Eye: Uyghur Themed Threat Activity // Description: This paper documents attempted exploitation activity aimed at Uyghur interests outside of China. Exploitation is being attempted via the usual tactic of spear phishing containing malicious attachments to targets. The exploit code attached used for dropping the malware is older - CVE-2012-0158 - and from our vantage point, we have no indication of successful or failed exploitation. Nonetheless, we can obtain targeting information and insight into tactics from the spearphish messages used by the threat actors. Successful exploitation typically results in malware calling back to one or more Uyghur themed domain names. The malware payloads observed to be associated with the Uyghur themed C2 domains so far consist of PlugX, Gh0st RAT, and Saker/Xbox, although there may be others that are yet to be discovered. // Refs.: https://www.arbornetworks.com/blog/asert/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/TLP-WHITE-Flying-Dragon-Eye-Uyghur-Themed-Threat-Activity.pdf // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/494956522456355543549598365.json</div>

This relatively new technique makes it difficult to detect the malware--especially on behavior-based malware detection systems. The malware checks for sinkholing of its control servers before each network communication session and does not initiate its malicious activities--such as downloading and running the malicious payload(s)--if it thinks the Domain Name Service (DNS) records have been sinkholed. The downloader also uses an uncommon technique to perform a timing check to decide whether it should perform its malicious activities. // Refs.: https://blogs.mcafee.com/mcafee-labs/rovnix-downloader-sinkhole-time-checks/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/8459349262369526564589662239425.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: Privileges and Credentials: Phished at the Request of Counsel // Description: In May and June 2017, FireEye observed a phishing campaign targeting at least seven global law and investment firms. We have associated this campaign with APT19, a group that we assess is composed of freelancers, with some degree of sponsorship by the Chinese government.APT19 used three different techniques to attempt to compromise targets. In early May, the phishing lures leveraged RTF attachments that exploited the Microsoft Windows vulnerability described in CVE 2017-0199. Toward the end of May, APT19 switched to using macro-enabled Microsoft Excel (XLSM) documents. In the most recent versions, APT19 added an application whitelisting bypass to the macro-enabled Microsoft Excel (XLSM) documents. At least one observed phishing lure delivered a Cobalt Strike payload. // Refs.: https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/06/phished-at-the-request-of-counsel.html // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/429599282999689956863384832.json</div>
