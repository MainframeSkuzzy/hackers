<div id='otxpost'> Name: Shamoon is back // Description: In August 2012, an attack campaign known as Shamoon targeted a Saudi Arabian energy company to deliver a malware called Disttrack. Disttrack is a multipurpose tool that exhibits worm-like behavior by attempting to spread to other systems on a local network using stolen administrator credentials. More importantly, its claim to fame is the ability to destroy data and to render infected systems unusable. The attack four years ago resulted in 30,000 or more systems being damaged.Last week, Unit 42 came across new Disttrack samples that appear to have been used in an updated attack campaign. The attack targeted at least one organization in Saudi Arabia, which aligns with the targeting of the initial Shamoon attacks. It appears the purpose of the new Disttrack samples were solely focused on destruction, as the samples were configured with a non-operational C2 server to report to and were set to begin wiping data exactly on 2016/11/17 20:45. // Refs.: http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/11/unit42-shamoon-2-return-disttrack-wiper/ , https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2016/11/fireeye_respondsto.html , https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/shamoon-back-dead-and-destructive-ever , https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/mcafee-labs/shamoon-rebooted/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/699822685883642864.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: Sakula Malware Family // Description: Dell SecureWorks Counter Threat Unit(TM) (CTU) researchers analyzed multiple versions of a remote access trojan (RAT) named Sakula (also known as Sakurel and VIPER). The RAT, which according to compile timestamps first surfaced in November 2012, has been used in targeted intrusions through 2015. Sakula enables an adversary to run interactive commands as well as to download and execute additional components.Sakula uses HTTP GET and POST communication for command and control (C2). Network communication is obfuscated with single-byte XOR encoding. Sakula also leverages single-byte XOR encoding to obfuscate various strings and files embedded in the resource section, which are subsequently used for User Account Control (UAC) bypass on both 32 and 64-bit systems. Most samples maintain persistence through a registry Run key, although some samples configure themselves as a service. // Refs.: http://www.secureworks.com/cyber-threat-intelligence/threats/sakula-malware-family/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/29985543422244665963624252298254.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: Defaulting on Passwords (Part 1): r0_bot // Description: Early in March, while studying the ChinaZ threat, it became readily apparent that default passwords were being used for more than just a supplementary attack vector. Several bots relied heavily, if not exclusively, on systems with weak and/or default passwords to spread. We setup a system with weak and default passwords to capture any and all malware spread in this fashion. For this first test, I selected 5 sets of passwords; admin/admin, guest/guest, ubnt/ubnt, cisco/cisco and ADMIN/ADMIN (the last for picking up folks scanning for Supermicro IPMI devices). Unsurprisingly, it took just under 3 hours for the first infection to hit. What did surprise us though was what password combination was first to be hit; ubnt/ubnt. // Refs.: http://blog.cari.net/carisirt-defaulting-on-passwords-part-1-r0_bot/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/3943894899845533633699226.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: Report on North Korean cyber attacks // Description: In February 2016, Novetta announced a profiling report entitled &amp;quot;Operation Blockbuster: Unraveling the Long Thread of Sony Attack&amp;quot; in association with global security companies (Kaspersky Lab, Symantec, Trend Micro, JPCERT / CC, etc.). The Lazarus group, which has been identified as the backbone of the report, has been active in the past, and Novetta &amp;#39;s research is helping to preemptively counteract and prevent Lazarus attacks around the world. However, global security companies are limited in collecting attack information in Korea, and there is also a lack of information about the attacks that Lazarus or Lazarus are suspected of as a small group of threat groups in Korea. Therefore, the Korea Financial Supervisory Service (KFAS) identified the specific characteristics of domestic IT and work environment, and profiled specific threat groups that are using the attacks. The results are described in this report. // Refs.: http://www.fsec.or.kr/common/proc/fsec/bbs/21/fileDownLoad/1235.do // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/4833226533882325884342824.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: New Carbanak / Anunak Attack Methodology // Description: In the last month Trustwave was engaged by two separate hospitality clients, and one restaurant chain for investigations by an unknown attacker or attackers. The modus operandi for all three investigations were very similar and appear to be a new Carbanak gang attack methodology, focused on the hospitality industry. Carbanak is a prolific crime group, well known for stealing over one billion dollars from banks in 2015 (*Kaspersky estimated loss) and more recently orchestrating an attack on the Oracle Micros POS support site that put over one million Point of Sale systems at risk. The current investigations are still underway but the known indicators of compromise in these new attacks will be presented below. At the time of investigation this malware was not correctly detected by any existing antivirus engines, and domains / IP&amp;#39;s were not found in any commercial threat intelligence feeds. // Refs.: https://www.trustwave.com/Resources/SpiderLabs-Blog/New-Carbanak-/-Anunak-Attack-Methodology/?page=1&amp;amp;year=0&amp;amp;month=0 // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/824394428999696266334922245948.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: Moonlight - Targeted attacks in the Middle East // Description: Vectra Threat Labs researchers have uncovered the activities of a group of individuals currently engaged in targeted attacks against entities in the Middle East. We identified over two hundred samples of malware generated by the group over the last two years. These attacks are themed around Middle Eastern political issues and the motivation appears to relate to espionage, as opposed to opportunistic or criminal intentions.These are not technically sophisticated attackers. However, they do deploy some novel tactics, detailed below, and the implications of these attacks could be significant. Both the tools and targets of Moonlight are reminiscent of &quot;Gaza Hacker Team,&quot; a group of attackers that are said to be politically aligned to the Hamas[1]. In spite of these commonalities, we have not identified any firm links between the two groups.We refer to this group of attackers as Moonlight, after the name the attackers chose for one of their command-and-control domains. // Refs.: http://blog.vectranetworks.com/blog/moonlight-middle-east-targeted-attacks // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/649986383658884292696.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: VB Dropper and Shellcode for Hancitor Reveal New Techniques Behind Uptick // Description: The Hancitor downloader has been relatively quiet since a major campaign back in June 2016. But over the past week, while performing research using Palo Alto Networks AutoFocus, we noticed a large uptick in the delivery of the Hancitor malware family as they shifted away from H1N1 to distribute Pony and Vawtrak executables. In parallel, we received reports from other firms and security researchers seeing similar activity, which pushed us to look into this further.The delivery method for these documents remained consistent to other common malicious e-mail campaigns. Lures contained subjects related to recent invoices, or other matters requiring the victim&#x27;s attention, such as an overdue bill. These lures were expected, until we started digging into the actual documents attached and saw an interesting method within the Visual Basic (VB) macros in the attached documents used for dropping the malware. // Refs.: http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/08/unit42-vb-dropper-and-shellcode-for-hancitor-reveal-new-techniques-behind-uptick/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/668938529923554826623266295439.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: Jaff Ransomware and Suspicious PDF Delivery // Description: Forcepoint Security Labs(tm) have observed today a major malicious email campaign from the Necurs botnet spreading a new ransomware which appears to call itself &amp;#39;Jaff&amp;#39;, peaking within our telemetry at nearly 5m emails per hour. The emails sent by this campaign may look spartan to the professional eye but, as ever, the human point of interaction with systems is the most vulnerable: by potentially reaching so many individuals, campaigns such as this can - and do - succeed in infecting people. Add to this a ransom of 1.79 Bitcoins (approximately $3,300 at the time of the campaign) and the potential &amp;#39;value&amp;#39; of the campaign is significant. // Refs.: https://blogs.forcepoint.com/security-labs/jaff-enters-ransomware-scene-locky-style // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/3998652652296242848582655454995695.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: BEBLOH Expands to Japan in Latest Spam Attack // Description: An old banking Trojan has been operating in Europe on a low level has spiked in activity after migrating to Japan. Cybercriminals are using local brand names such as local ISP providers and legitimate looking addresses to fool users into downloading malware that can steal information by monitoring browsers, file transfer protocol (FTP) clients, and mail clients. Its targets? Mostly rural banks.BEBLOH is a banking Trojan that has been around since as early as 2009. It has outlived several competitors including Zeus, and SpyEye. It is designed to steal money from unsuspecting victims right off their bank accounts without them even noticing. BEBLOH always came up with new defensive measures to avoid AV products, and this time is no different. BEBLOH is also known for hiding in memory and creating a temporary new executable file upon shutdown, and deleting said file after re-infecting the system. // Refs.: http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/bebloh-expands-japan-latest-spam-attack/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/68486224394338484329936426634549.json</div>
