<div id='otxpost'> Name: Operation Wilted Tulip // Description: CopyKittens is a cyberespionage group that has been operating since at least 2013. In November 2015, ClearSky and Minerva Labs published the first public report exposing its activity. In March 2017, ClearSky published a second report exposing further incidents, some of which impacted the German Bundestag. In this report, Trend Micro and ClearSky expose a vast espionage apparatus spanning the entire time the group has been active. It includes recent incidents as well as older ones that have not been publicly reported; new malware; exploitation, delivery and command and control infrastructure; and the group&amp;#39;s modus operandi.We dubbed this activity Operation Wilted Tulip // Refs.: http://www.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Operation_Wilted_Tulip.pdf // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/9589556888284546449692.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: Real News, Fake Flash Mac OS X Users Targeted // Description: Volexity recently identified a breach to the website of a well regarded media outlet in the country of Georgia. As part of this breach, the media organization&#x27;s website was being leveraged as a component of a malware campaign targeting select visitors. The news organization provides reporting on its website in English, Georgian, and Russian. However, only the Georgian language portion of the website was impacted and used in an effort to distribute malware. The targets were then further narrowed to those that were running the Mac OS X operating system, had not previously visited the website, and had specific browser versions. The attackers accomplished much of this with JavaScript they placed on the media organization&#x27;s website. // Refs.: https://www.volexity.com/blog/2017/07/24/real-news-fake-flash-mac-os-x-users-targeted/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/2399323368999669235654898.json</div>

The first malware program belongingto this family was spotted in May 2016 and was dubbed Linux.DDoS.87. At the beginning ofAugust, a new version of this Trojan--Linux.DDoS.89--was discovered. Finally, Doctor Web&#x27;s securityresearchers investigated the Linux.Mirai Trojan found later that month. // Refs.: https://st.drweb.com/static/new-www/news/2016/september/Investigation_of_Linux.Mirai_Trojan_family_en.pdf // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/49342434236653822299442856282.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: Scarlet Mimic: Espionage Campaign Targets Minority Activists // Description: Over the past seven months, Unit 42 has been investigating a series of attacks we attribute to a group we have code named &quot;Scarlet Mimic.&quot; The attacks began over four years ago and their targeting pattern suggests that this adversary&#x27;s primary mission is to gather information about minority rights activists. We do not have evidence directly linking these attacks to a government source, but the information derived from these activities supports an assessment that a group or groups with motivations similar to the stated position of the Chinese government in relation to these targets is involved.The attacks we attribute to Scarlet Mimic have primarily targeted Uyghur and Tibetan activists as well as those who are interested in their causes. Both the Tibetan community and the Uyghurs, a Turkic Muslim minority residing primarily in northwest China, have been targets of multiple sophisticated attacks in the past decade. // Refs.: http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/01/scarlet-mimic-years-long-espionage-targets-minority-activists/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/5829648884664486662923482.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: BEBLOH Expands to Japan in Latest Spam Attack // Description: An old banking Trojan has been operating in Europe on a low level has spiked in activity after migrating to Japan. Cybercriminals are using local brand names such as local ISP providers and legitimate looking addresses to fool users into downloading malware that can steal information by monitoring browsers, file transfer protocol (FTP) clients, and mail clients. Its targets? Mostly rural banks.BEBLOH is a banking Trojan that has been around since as early as 2009. It has outlived several competitors including Zeus, and SpyEye. It is designed to steal money from unsuspecting victims right off their bank accounts without them even noticing. BEBLOH always came up with new defensive measures to avoid AV products, and this time is no different. BEBLOH is also known for hiding in memory and creating a temporary new executable file upon shutdown, and deleting said file after re-infecting the system. // Refs.: http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/bebloh-expands-japan-latest-spam-attack/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/68486224394338484329936426634549.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: New Carbanak / Anunak Attack Methodology // Description: In the last month Trustwave was engaged by two separate hospitality clients, and one restaurant chain for investigations by an unknown attacker or attackers. The modus operandi for all three investigations were very similar and appear to be a new Carbanak gang attack methodology, focused on the hospitality industry. Carbanak is a prolific crime group, well known for stealing over one billion dollars from banks in 2015 (*Kaspersky estimated loss) and more recently orchestrating an attack on the Oracle Micros POS support site that put over one million Point of Sale systems at risk. The current investigations are still underway but the known indicators of compromise in these new attacks will be presented below. At the time of investigation this malware was not correctly detected by any existing antivirus engines, and domains / IP&amp;#39;s were not found in any commercial threat intelligence feeds. // Refs.: https://www.trustwave.com/Resources/SpiderLabs-Blog/New-Carbanak-/-Anunak-Attack-Methodology/?page=1&amp;amp;year=0&amp;amp;month=0 // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/824394428999696266334922245948.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: Operation Black Atlas, Part 2 // Description: Operation Black Atlas has already spread to a multi-state healthcare provider, dental clinics, a machine manufacturer, a technology company focusing on insurance services, a gas station that has a multi-state presence, and a beauty supply shop. It continues to spread across small and medium-sized businesses across the globe, using the modular Gorynych/Diamond Fox botnet to exfiltrate stolen data. // Refs.: http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/operation-black-atlas-part-2-tools-and-malware-used-and-how-to-detect-them/ , http://documents.trendmicro.com/assets/Operation%20Black%20Atlas_Indicators_of_Compromise.pdf , http://documents.trendmicro.com/assets/Operation_Black%20Atlas_Technical_Brief.pdf // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/946289955425834629.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: When ELF.BillGates met Windows // Description: The &quot;Elf.BillGates&quot; version targets Linux operating system. We have followed the activities of this botnet for several months and during our investigations we found some versions of a Windows fork of the malware. This article attempts to detail this variant.The primary infection vector is the exploit of the vulnerability CVE-2014-6332[3], which drops the binary file hosted on an HTTPd File Server (HFS)[4]. This vulnerability allows an attacker to escape the Internet Explorer sandbox with a VBScript script and execute an arbitrary binary file downloaded from the Internet. // Refs.: http://thisissecurity.net/2015/09/30/when-elf-billgates-met-windows/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/3656338325589822222843238996836923.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: Attacks against Israeli &amp; Palestinian interests // Description: Series of attacks mostly against Israel-based organisations. The decoy documents and filenames used in the attacks suggest the intended targets include organisations with political interests or influence in Israel and Palestine. // Refs.:  // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/684688443544294559832285693245822.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: NetTraveler APT Targets Russian, European Interests // Description: Throughout 2016, Proofpoint researchers tracked a cyber-espionage campaign targeting victims in Russia and neighboring countries. The actor utilizes spear phishing campaigns to deliver NetTraveler, also known as TravNet. First observed as early as 2004, NetTraveler is a Trojan used widely in targeted attacks. We believe that this attacker operates out of China. In addition to Russia, targeted regions include neighboring countries such as Mongolia, Belarus, and other European countries. The spear-phishing campaigns we detected use links to RAR-compressed executables and Microsoft Word attachments that exploit the CVE-2012-0158 vulnerability.This particular APT is targeting organizations that include weapons manufacturers, human rights activists, and pro-democracy groups, among others. // Refs.: https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/nettraveler-apt-targets-russian-european-interests // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/93428453553929869223833388532542.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: Odinaff: New Trojan used in high level financial attacks // Description: Since January 2016, discreet campaigns involving malware called Trojan.Odinaff have targeted a number of financial organizations worldwide. These attacks appear to be extremely focused on organizations operating in the banking, securities, trading, and payroll sectors. Organizations who provide support services to these industries are also of interest.Odinaff is typically deployed in the first stage of an attack, to gain a foothold onto the network, providing a persistent presence and the ability to install additional tools onto the target network. These additional tools bear the hallmarks of a sophisticated attacker which has plagued the financial industry since at least 2013-Carbanak. This new wave of attacks has also used some infrastructure that has previously been used in Carbanak campaigns. // Refs.: http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/odinaff-new-trojan-used-high-level-financial-attacks // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/6235636829392845823683649898546.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: Retefe Banking Trojan // Description: (PaloAlto) Retefe is one of the most targeted banking Trojans currently in the wild. While other families such as Zeus and Citadel are widely adopted by attackers targeting banking websites around the world, Retefe is consistently used to target victims in Sweden, Switzerland and Japan.This Pulse includes indicators extended from Alienvault Labs Intelligence // Refs.: http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2015/08/retefe-banking-trojan-targets-sweden-switzerland-and-japan/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/955366439888454588552395.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: New &amp;quot;Bart&amp;quot; Ransomware from Threat Actors Spreading Dridex and Locky // Description: The actors behind Dridex 220 and Locky Affid=3 have introduced a new ransomware called &quot;Bart&quot;. They are using the RockLoader malware to download Bart over HTTPS. Bart has a payment screen like Locky but encrypts files without first connecting to a command and control (C&amp;amp;C) server. // Refs.: https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/New-Bart-Ransomware-from-Threat-Actors-Spreading-Dridex-and-Locky // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/4432948458833425225896526.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: Data-Stealing NionSpy File Infector // Description: W32/NionSpy is a family of malware that steals information from infected machines and replicates to new machines over networks and removable thumb drives. Aside from stealing keystrokes, passwords, Bitcoins, system information, and files on disk, NionSpy (also known as Mewsei and MewsSpy) can record video (using the webcam), audio (using the microphone), take screenshots, and use infected machines as a proxy tunnel to connect to other machines within the network. // Refs.:  // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/383435456888236854932255998663526.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: Rovnix Downloader Updated with SinkHole and Time Checks // Description: McAfee Labs has found that the latest Rovnix downloader now comes with the capability to check for the sinkholing of its control servers. This relatively new technique makes it difficult to detect the malware--especially on behavior-based malware detection systems. The malware checks for sinkholing of its control servers before each network communication session and does not initiate its malicious activities--such as downloading and running the malicious payload(s)--if it thinks the Domain Name Service (DNS) records have been sinkholed. The downloader also uses an uncommon technique to perform a timing check to decide whether it should perform its malicious activities. // Refs.: https://blogs.mcafee.com/mcafee-labs/rovnix-downloader-sinkhole-time-checks/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/8459349262369526564589662239425.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: Magic Hound Campaign Attacks Saudi Targets // Description: Unit 42 has discovered a persistent attack campaign operating primarily in the Middle East dating back to at least mid-2016 which we have named Magic Hound. This appears to be an attack campaign focused on espionage. Based upon our visibility it has primarily targeted organizations in the energy, government, and technology sectors that are either in in or business interests in Saudi Arabia. The adversaries appear to have evolved their tactics and techniques throughout the tracked time-period, iterating through a diverse toolset across different waves of attacks. Link analysis of infrastructure and tools also revealed a potential relationship between Magic Hound and the adversary group called &quot;Rocket Kitten&quot; (AKA Operation Saffron Rose, Ajax Security Team, Operation Woolen-Goldfish) as well as an older attack campaign called Newscasters. // Refs.: http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2017/02/unit42-magic-hound-campaign-attacks-saudi-targets/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/28968589956339392834584922.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: Hancitor and Ruckguv Reappear, Updated and With Vawtrak On Deck // Description: Proofpoint researchers have recently observed the re-emergence of two malware downloaders that had largely disappeared for several months. Hancitor (also known as Tordal and Chanitor) and Ruckguv have reappeared in campaigns distributing Pony and Vawtrak with significant updates and increased functionality. We have also been tracking an actor experimenting with various loaders, providing insights into these evolving components of malware ecosystems. // Refs.: https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/hancitor-ruckguv-reappear // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/59463692849548999628524.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: Dridex actors distributing the Shifu banking Trojan // Description: Following a month-long hiatus after a number of arrests, and despite a recent reported takedown, Dridex actors appear to have taken the recent disruptions as a challenge to bounce back better than ever. Proofpoint researchers analyzed the activity in the recent return to operations of the Dridex actors and identified numerous changes in behavior, from technical innovations to distributing other banking and data-stealing malware. // Refs.: https://proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/Not-Yet-Dead // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/56699492825523358666949289386.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: Ostap Bender: 400 Ways to Make the Population Part With Their Money // Description: In late October, Proofpoint researchers identified and began tracking a financially-motivated threat actor group with access to banking Trojans and other malware, including Dridex, Ursnif, Tinba, and the point-of-sale (POS) malware AbaddonPOS with its loader, TinyLoader. More significantly, the group also uses a previously undocumented JScript backdoor called &quot;Ostap&quot; and a Delphi dropper we named &quot;MrWhite&quot;. MrWhite can profile the victim systems for the presence of running POS software before dropping further POS payloads. Adding this extra layer of filtering may help the group focus on targets of interest and evade detection due to use of known malware.So far, these campaigns have targeted countries including Germany, Austria, and the United Kingdom. While vertical targeting varies, we observed a significant focus on Financial Services. // Refs.: https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/ostap-bender-400-ways-make-population-part-with-their-money // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/96452588564464258688.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: T9000: Advanced Modular Backdoor Uses Complex Anti-Analysis // Description: Most custom backdoors used by advanced attackers have limited functionality. They evade detection by keeping their code simple and flying under the radar. But during a recent investigation we found a backdoor that takes a very different approach. We refer to this backdoor as T9000, which is a newer variant of the T5000 malware family, also known as Plat1.In addition to the basic functionality all backdoors provide, T9000 allows the attacker to capture encrypted data, take screenshots of specific applications and specifically target Skype users. The malware goes to great lengths to identify a total of 24 potential security products that may be running on a system and customizes its installation mechanism to specifically evade those that are installed. It uses a multi-stage installation process with specific checks at each point to identify if it is undergoing analysis by a security researcher.The primary functionality of this tool is to gather information about the victim. // Refs.: http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/02/t9000-advanced-modular-backdoor-uses-complex-anti-analysis-techniques/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/36389935983936293448232446229.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: TREASUREHUNT: A CUSTOM POS MALWARE TOOL // Description: Since early 2015, FireEye Threat Intelligence has observed the significant growth of point-of-sale (POS) malware families in underground cyber crime forums. POS malware refers to malicious software that extracts payment card information from memory and usually uploads that data to a command and control (CnC) server.In this article FireEye examines TREASUREHUNT, POS malware that appears to have been custom-built for the operations of a particular &quot;dump shop,&quot; which sells stolen credit card data. TREASUREHUNT enumerates running processes, extracts payment card information from memory, and then transmits this information to a command and control server. // Refs.: https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2016/03/treasurehunt_a_cust.html // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/924342855924498292238332426.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: Hancitor Downloader Spam Runs // Description: Hancitor is one of the better-known malware downloaders due to its numerous SPAM runs and evolving delivery technique. It reminds us of Upatre, which gained notoriety status over the past two years but has now died down, possibly due to the takedowns of its major payloads. In the case of Hancitor, it still seen as a favourite carrier of very much active malware families such as Pony and Vawtrak.Just recently, we found a new spam campaign of Hancitor with some notable developments that may have been in the previous variants, but were not discussed in any other reports. This article revolves around the macro tricks it uses to stall analysts, and new commands that it utilizes to better persist on infected devices. Finally, this variant also contains an interesting piece of comment by the malware author written in the macro code, which made us feel obliged to take a closer look in the first place. // Refs.: https://blog.fortinet.com/2016/11/02/the-angry-spam-and-the-tricky-macro-delivers-updated-hancitor , https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/portal/Threat/Encyclopedia/Entry.aspx?Name=TrojanDownloader:Win32/Zdowbot.C // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/2355633998325625943424288882.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: Petya Returns as Goldeneye Strikes Germany // Description: A new variant of the notorious ransomware Petya is back - again - and with yet another James Bond reference for a name: Goldeneye. Presumably from the same author of Petya, which was first seen in December 2016, and the Petya-Mischa combo, which hit users back in July 2016, Janus Cybercrime Solution&#x27;s latest creation is another step in the evolution of their ransomware-as-a-service expansion.Petya is a form of ransomware that overwrites the master boot record (MBR) in order to block access to both the user&#x27;s files and operating system. Safe Mode access is also disabled. Once Petya executes, the user&#x27;s machine will crash, restart, and show a skull-and-crossbones animation before displaying a ransom note asking for payment in bitcoin (BTC) in order to decrypt the system. // Refs.: https://blog.cylance.com/petya-returns-as-goldeneye-strikes-germany // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/652395244942426389984832266.json</div>

It appears to be run by a Russian-speaking group of hackers.The forum provides members with tools to patch RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) servers to supportmultiple user logins, as well as other hacking tools, such as proxy installers and sysinfo collectors. Themain goal of the xDedic forum is to facilitate the buying and selling of credentials for hacked serverswhich are available through RDP.From governmental networks to corporations, it is possible to find almost anything on xDedic for as littleas 6 USD per server. This one-time cost provides a malicious &amp;quot;customer&amp;quot; with access to all the data onthe server and endless other possibilities, such as using the access to launch further attacks. // Refs.: https://securelist.com/files/2016/06/xDedic_marketplace_ENG.pdf // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/624438322454845889282893664948.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: Grabit and the RATs // Description: Not so long ago, Kaspersky clients in the United States approached Kaspersky researchers with a request to investigate a new type of malicious software that they were able to recover from their organizations&#x27; servers. The malware calls itself Grabit and is distinctive because of its versatile behavior. Every sample we found was different in size and activity from the others but the internal name and other identifiers were disturbingly similar. The timestamp seems valid and close to the documented infection timeline. Our documentation points to a campaign that started somewhere in late February 2015 and ended in mid-March. As the development phase supposedly ended, malware started spreading from India, the United States and Israel to other countries around the globe. // Refs.: https://securelist.com/blog/research/70087/grabit-and-the-rats/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/9868344422858499528425839.json</div>

This cyber-espionage group was dubbed &#x27;Rocket Kitten,&#x27; and remains activeas of this writing, with reported attacks as recent as October 2015.The Rocket Kitten group and its attacks have been analyzed on numerous occasions byseveral vendors and security professionals, resulting in various reports describing thegroup&#x27;s method of operation, tools and techniques.Characterized by relatively unsophisticated technical merit and extensive use of spearphishing, the group targeted individuals and organizations in the Middle East (includingtargets inside Iran itself), as well as across Europe and in the United States. // Refs.: http://blog.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/rocket-kitten-report.pdf // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/43339553486858462622544382.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: Packrat: Seven Years of a South American Threat Actor // Description: This report describes an extensive malware, phishing, and disinformation campaign active in several Latin American countries, including Ecuador, Argentina, Venezuela, and Brazil. The nature and geographic spread of the targets seems to point to a sponsor, or sponsors, with regional, political interests. The attackers, whom we have named Packrat, have shown a keen and systematic interest in the political opposition and the independent press in so-called ALBA countries (Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas), and their recently allied regimes. These countries are linked by a trade agreement as well as a cooperation on a range of non-financial matters. // Refs.: https://github.com/citizenlab/malware-signatures/blob/master/packrat/domains.csv , https://github.com/citizenlab/malware-signatures/blob/master/packrat/md5-c2.csv , https://citizenlab.org/2015/12/packrat-report/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/3568835395299939864532926.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: Flying Dragon Eye: Uyghur Themed Threat Activity // Description: This paper documents attempted exploitation activity aimed at Uyghur interests outside of China. Exploitation is being attempted via the usual tactic of spear phishing containing malicious attachments to targets. The exploit code attached used for dropping the malware is older - CVE-2012-0158 - and from our vantage point, we have no indication of successful or failed exploitation. Nonetheless, we can obtain targeting information and insight into tactics from the spearphish messages used by the threat actors. Successful exploitation typically results in malware calling back to one or more Uyghur themed domain names. The malware payloads observed to be associated with the Uyghur themed C2 domains so far consist of PlugX, Gh0st RAT, and Saker/Xbox, although there may be others that are yet to be discovered. // Refs.: https://www.arbornetworks.com/blog/asert/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/TLP-WHITE-Flying-Dragon-Eye-Uyghur-Themed-Threat-Activity.pdf // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/494956522456355543549598365.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: #1020 Dissecting the Malware Involved in the INOCNATION Campaign // Description: Last month, CrowdStrike published a blog on malware campaigns attributed to Sakula. We took a look at the malware specifically in the INOCNATION campaign to analyze what was new and different about the techniques used by the threat actor. It appears the entity behind this campaign took steps to make reverse engineering more difficult and chose the use of Cisco&#x27;s AnyConnect Client as a lure to trick victims into installing the malware.The RAT delivered by this campaign was not particularly interesting and had all the features you would expect in such a tool. The use of the obfuscation techniques was novel and this advisory discusses those in detail, along with how we detected them. // Refs.: https://www.fidelissecurity.com/sites/default/files/FTA_1020_Fidelis_Inocnation_FINAL.pdf , http://www.threatgeek.com/2015/12/fidelis-threat-advisory-1020-dissecting-the-malware-involved-in-the-inocnation-campaign.html // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/89642393868938882353946594389.json</div>

These emails are mainly sent to Colombians who may work in the accounting or finance departments of various-sized organizations. The people behind the attacks are likely attempting to gain access to computers where banking transactions are performed, in order to steal banking credentials. // Refs.: http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/colombians-major-target-email-campaigns-delivering-xtreme-rat // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/59468566399494965286488389.json</div>

In this blog we begin with data from a real attack in the wild, and use the evidence from that attack to make a connection back to underground forums and the actors who are using them.The malware we observed on this infrastructure was almost uniquely commodity RATs including DarkComet, DarkTrack, LuminosityLink, NJRAT, ImminentMonitor, NanoCore, Orcus, NetWireRAT, BabylonRAT, Remcos, ZyklonHTTP, SandroRAT, RevengeRAT, SpyNote, QuasarRAT, and HWorm. // Refs.: http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2017/01/unit42-exploring-cybercrime-underground-part-3-rat-nest/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/842488432926555896854256996886668884.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: MALWARE POSING AS HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS AND COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE TARGETING IRANIANS AND FOREIGN POLICY INSTITUTIONS // Description: On August 4, 2016, the Gmail account of an unknown individual was compromised in order to conduct spearphishing campaigns against a diverse set of targets related to Iran. The spearphishing attempt posed as a message from the Director of United for Iran, a U.S.-based human rights organization, claiming that the organization had developed a secure communications tool for activists. The message was sent from an account created under her name on lesser known email provider (1&amp;amp;1&#x27;s Mail.com), a common tactic in recent months, with a link to a file hosted on Dropbox and an additional credential phishing attempt. Once the observed Gmail account was under their control, the actors then forwarded malware to over a hundred of their contacts, ranging from an address for the United Nations Refugee Agency in Turkey to a site contact for Reza Pahlavi, the son of the deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. // Refs.: https://iranthreats.github.io/resources/human-rights-impersonation-malware/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/438536325523956889.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: Teaching an old RAT new tricks // Description: Recently we detected a more sophisticated technique that a handful of countries across Asia are actively using to infect systems with RATs.  This new technique ensures that the payload/file remains in memory through its execution, never touching the disk in a de-encrypted state.  In doing so, the attacker can remain out of view from antivirus technologies, and even &#x27;next-generation&#x27; technologies that only focus on file-based threat vectors.  Also, the samples analyzed have the ability detect the presence of a virtual machine to ensure it&#x27;s not being analyzed in a network sandbox.And finally it&#x27;s important to highlight that the RAT itself is not new. // Refs.: https://www.sentinelone.com/blogs/teaching-an-old-rat-new-tricks/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/683263385648448865254264268.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: Moonlight - Targeted attacks in the Middle East // Description: Vectra Threat Labs researchers have uncovered the activities of a group of individuals currently engaged in targeted attacks against entities in the Middle East. We identified over two hundred samples of malware generated by the group over the last two years. These attacks are themed around Middle Eastern political issues and the motivation appears to relate to espionage, as opposed to opportunistic or criminal intentions.These are not technically sophisticated attackers. However, they do deploy some novel tactics, detailed below, and the implications of these attacks could be significant. Both the tools and targets of Moonlight are reminiscent of &quot;Gaza Hacker Team,&quot; a group of attackers that are said to be politically aligned to the Hamas[1]. In spite of these commonalities, we have not identified any firm links between the two groups.We refer to this group of attackers as Moonlight, after the name the attackers chose for one of their command-and-control domains. // Refs.: http://blog.vectranetworks.com/blog/moonlight-middle-east-targeted-attacks // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/649986383658884292696.json</div>
