<div id='otxpost'> Name: FIN7 Evolution and the Phishing LNK // Description: FIN7 is a financially-motivated threat group that has been associated with malicious operations dating back to late 2015. FIN7 is referred to by many vendors as &quot;Carbanak Group&quot;, although we do not equate all usage of the CARBANAK backdoor with FIN7. FireEye recently observed a FIN7 spear phishing campaign targeting personnel involved with United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings at various organizations.In a newly-identified campaign, FIN7 modified their phishing techniques to implement unique infection and persistence mechanisms. FIN7 has moved away from weaponized Microsoft Office macros in order to evade detection. This round of FIN7 phishing lures implements hidden shortcut files (LNK files) to initiate the infection and VBScript functionality launched by mshta.exe to infect the victim. // Refs.: https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/04/fin7-phishing-lnk.html // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/8822263824938685835393425692649.json</div>

This cyber-espionage group was dubbed &#x27;Rocket Kitten,&#x27; and remains activeas of this writing, with reported attacks as recent as October 2015.The Rocket Kitten group and its attacks have been analyzed on numerous occasions byseveral vendors and security professionals, resulting in various reports describing thegroup&#x27;s method of operation, tools and techniques.Characterized by relatively unsophisticated technical merit and extensive use of spearphishing, the group targeted individuals and organizations in the Middle East (includingtargets inside Iran itself), as well as across Europe and in the United States. // Refs.: http://blog.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/rocket-kitten-report.pdf // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/43339553486858462622544382.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: Probes for SMTP relays // Description: A couple of IP addresses have been probing multiple SMTP servers, probing for relaying with and without authentication. My honeypot accepted the probes authentication credentials.If a relay accepting authentication is found, an email is submitted to xderia@outlook.com with the subject [Hey] $ip_address,$username,$password (obviously with correct values). The probes test at least the username &amp;#39;anyuser&amp;#39; and password &amp;#39;anypass&amp;#39;.Some sender email addresses are probably unrelated and listing them as IoCs could harm innocent third parties, but the other email addresses listed as IoCs are very specific and also seem to be the result of some faulty spambot logic. // Refs.:  // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/42528936582969559633584966544923.json</div>

In order to infect the victims, the attackers distributed spear-phishing email, which purports to have been sent from NIC&#x27;s Incident response team, the attackers spoofed an email id that is associated with Indian Ministry of Defence to send out email to the victims. Attackers also used the name of the top NIC official in the signature of the email, this is to make it look like the email was sent by a high ranking Government official working at NIC (National Informatics Centre). // Refs.: https://cysinfo.com/malware-actors-using-nic-cyber-security-themed-spear-phishing-target-indian-government-organizations/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/6929998625465492958886328886539.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: Shamoon is back // Description: In August 2012, an attack campaign known as Shamoon targeted a Saudi Arabian energy company to deliver a malware called Disttrack. Disttrack is a multipurpose tool that exhibits worm-like behavior by attempting to spread to other systems on a local network using stolen administrator credentials. More importantly, its claim to fame is the ability to destroy data and to render infected systems unusable. The attack four years ago resulted in 30,000 or more systems being damaged.Last week, Unit 42 came across new Disttrack samples that appear to have been used in an updated attack campaign. The attack targeted at least one organization in Saudi Arabia, which aligns with the targeting of the initial Shamoon attacks. It appears the purpose of the new Disttrack samples were solely focused on destruction, as the samples were configured with a non-operational C2 server to report to and were set to begin wiping data exactly on 2016/11/17 20:45. // Refs.: http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/11/unit42-shamoon-2-return-disttrack-wiper/ , https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2016/11/fireeye_respondsto.html , https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/shamoon-back-dead-and-destructive-ever , https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/mcafee-labs/shamoon-rebooted/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/699822685883642864.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: Operation Potao Express // Description: ESET presented our initial findings based on research into the Win32/Potao malware family in June, in our CCCC 2015 presentation in Copenhagen. Today, we are releasing the full whitepaper on the Potao malware with additional findings, the cyberespionage campaigns where it was employed, and its connection to a backdoor in the form of a modified version of the TrueCrypt encryption software.Like BlackEnergy, the malware used by the so-called Sandworm APT group (also known as Quedagh), Potao is an example of targeted espionage malware directed mostly at targets in Ukraine and a number of other post-Soviet countries, including Russia, Georgia and Belarus. // Refs.: http://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Operation-Potao-Express_final_v2.pdf , https://github.com/eset/malware-ioc/tree/master/potao // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/666982922222383994254354546.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: Digging for groundhogs: holes in your linux server // Description: In July 2015, Check Point&#x27;s Incident Response team was contacted by a customer after they noticed strange file system activities in one of their Linux-based DNS BIND servers. This strange behavior consisted of a large amount of peculiar files being written into sensitive system directories. A thorough analysis of the infected system by our Incident Response and Malware Research teams quickly revealed that the server was indeed compromised. The source of this compromise was traced to an SSH brute force attack that took place earlier the same month. The attacking IP addresses originated from very distinctive network ranges mostly associated with Chinese Internet  service providers. Using this SSH brute-forcing network, it took the attackers only a few days to gain root access and full control of the targeted server. Once they obtained access to the server, the  attackers infected the system with two malicious payloads. // Refs.: http://blog.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/sb-report-threat-intelligence-groundhog.pdf // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/49262229322358296336544.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: Privileges and Credentials: Phished at the Request of Counsel // Description: In May and June 2017, FireEye observed a phishing campaign targeting at least seven global law and investment firms. We have associated this campaign with APT19, a group that we assess is composed of freelancers, with some degree of sponsorship by the Chinese government.APT19 used three different techniques to attempt to compromise targets. In early May, the phishing lures leveraged RTF attachments that exploited the Microsoft Windows vulnerability described in CVE 2017-0199. Toward the end of May, APT19 switched to using macro-enabled Microsoft Excel (XLSM) documents. In the most recent versions, APT19 added an application whitelisting bypass to the macro-enabled Microsoft Excel (XLSM) documents. At least one observed phishing lure delivered a Cobalt Strike payload. // Refs.: https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/06/phished-at-the-request-of-counsel.html // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/429599282999689956863384832.json</div>
