<div id='otxpost'> Name: Sakula Reloaded // Description: Sakula is a well known malware variant linked to several significant targeted intrusion campaigns over the past 2-3 years. This remote access toolkit has been publicly examined multiple times by the threat intelligence community. CrowdStrike has released two blog posts detailing Sakula campaigns and continues to investigate its usage. In the past two years, two campaigns of Sakula activity stand out as being particularly significant - the &quot;French Aerospace&quot; Campaign and the &quot;Ironman&quot; Campaign. In recent months, CrowdStrike has observed limited use of what appears to be a third Sakula variant. // Refs.: http://blog.crowdstrike.com/sakula-reloaded/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/24393633445639554946233596.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: New Attacks Linked to C0d0s0 Group // Description: Unit 42 discovered new activity that appears related to an adversary group previously called &quot;C0d0so0&quot; or &quot;Codoso&quot;. This group is well known for a widely publicized attack involving the compromise of Forbes.com, in which the site was used to compromise selected targets via a watering hole to a zero-day Adobe Flash exploit. Compared to other adversary groups, C0d0so0 has shown the use of more sophisticated tactics and tools and has been linked to leveraging zero-day exploits on numerous occasions in combination with watering hole and spear phishing attacks.In the newly discovered attack campaign, Unit 42 identified attacks targeting organizations within the telecommunications, high tech, education, manufacturing, and legal services industries. The attacks likely were initially delivered via spear-phishing e-mails, or as demonstrated by C0d0so0 in the past, legitimate websites that had been previously compromised then used as watering holes for the selected victims. // Refs.: http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/01/new-attacks-linked-to-c0d0s0-group/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/6658966649626494655592296926.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: Dino - allegedly French espionage // Description: Animal Farm is the security industry&#x27;s name for a group of attackers first described by Canada&#x27;s Communications Security Establishment (CSE) in a set of slides leaked by Edward Snowden in March 2014. In those slides CSE assess with &quot;moderate certainty&quot; that this group is a French intelligence agency. Since then, several examples of malware created by Animal Farm have been found and publicly documented, in particular: // Refs.: http://www.welivesecurity.com/2015/06/30/dino-spying-malware-analyzed/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/386263328633254248292925646232688638.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: TheDuqu 2.0 IOCs // Description: Some of the new 2014-2015 Duqu infections are linked to the P5+1 events and venues related to the negotiations with Iran about a nuclear deal. The threat actor behind Duqu appears to have launched attacks at the venues for some of these high level talks. In addition to the P5+1 events, the Duqu 2.0 group has launched a similar attack in relation to the 70th anniversary event of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau. // Refs.: https://securelist.com/blog/research/70504/the-mystery-of-duqu-2-0-a-sophisticated-cyberespionage-actor-returns/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/8995429486492238382863336.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: APT29 Domain Fronting With TOR // Description: Mandiant has observed Russian nation-state attackers APT29 employing domain fronting techniques for stealthy backdoor access to victim environments for at least two years. There has been considerable discussion about domain fronting following the release of a paper detailing these techniques. Domain fronting provides outbound network connections that are indistinguishable from legitimate requests for popular websites.APT29 has used The Onion Router (TOR) and the TOR domain fronting plugin meek to create a hidden, encrypted network tunnel that appeared to connect to Google services over TLS. This tunnel provided the attacker remote access to the host system using the Terminal Services (TS), NetBIOS, and Server Message Block (SMB) services, while appearing to be traffic to legitimate websites. The attackers also leveraged a common Windows exploit to access a privileged command shell without authenticating. // Refs.: https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/03/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/56265323853288386583389555869.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: Similarities Between Carbanak and FIN7 Malware Suggest Actors Are Closely Related // Description: Several days ago, researchers at FireEye attributed a recent phishing campaign to FIN7, a campaign in which cybercriminals delivered malicious Microsoft Office documents to users, deploying both Cobalt Strike and a VBS-based backdoor on infected workstations. This report contained a sentence of particular interest to Cyber4Sight: &quot;FIN7 is referred to by many vendors as &#x27;Carbanak Group,&#x27; although we do not equate all usage of the Carbanak backdoor with FIN7.&quot; In their previous report on this threat actor group, FireEye stopped short of making this direct connection, stating instead that &quot;The use of the CARBANAK malware in FIN7 operations also provides limited evidence that these campaigns are linked to previously observed CARBANAK operations leading to fraudulent banking transactions, ATM compromise, and other monetization schemes.&quot; // Refs.: https://blog.cyber4sight.com/2017/04/similarities-between-carbanak-and-fin7-malware-suggest-actors-are-closely-related/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/884683224848929569989426993583.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: New activity of the Blue Termite APT // Description: In October 2014, Kaspersky Lab started to research &quot;Blue Termite&quot;, an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) targeting Japan. The oldest sample we&#x27;ve seen up to now is from November 2013. This is not the first time the country has been a victim of an APT. However, the attack is different in two respects: unlike other APTs, the main focus of Blue Termite is to attack Japanese organizations; and most of their C2s are located in Japan. One of the top targets is the Japan Pension Service, but the list of targeted industries includes government and government agencies, local governments, public interest groups, universities, banks, financial services, energy, communication, heavy industry, chemical, automotive, electrical, news media, information services sector, health care, real estate, food, semiconductor, robotics, construction, insurance, transportation and so on. Unfortunately, the attack is still active and the number of victims has been increasing. // Refs.: https://securelist.com/blog/research/71876/new-activity-of-the-blue-termite-apt/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/4222535834368264624862984846245243.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: The Turbo Campaign, Featuring Derusbi for 64-bit Linux // Description: In the summer of 2015, Fidelis Cybersecurity had the opportunity to analyze a Derusbi malware sample used as partof a campaign we&#x27;ve labeled Turbo, for the associated kernel module that was deployed. Derusbi has been widelycovered and associated with Chinese threat actors. This malware has been reported to have been used in highprofile breaches like the ones at Wellpoint/Anthem, VAE Inc, USIS and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. Every one of thesecampaigns involved a Windows version of Derusbi. // Refs.: https://www.fidelissecurity.com/sites/default/files/TA_Fidelis_Turbo_1602%283%29.pdf , https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fideliscyber/indicators/master/FTA-1021/FTA%20%231021%20-%20The%20Turbo%20Campaign%20-%20Windows%20Samples%20of%20Derusbi_IOCs.csv // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/26283923822966896629295249559.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: Asruex: Malware Infecting through Shortcut Files // Description: JPCERT/CC has been observing malicious shortcut files that are sent as email attachments to a limited range of organisations since around October 2015. When this shortcut file is opened, the host will be infected with malware called &quot;Asruex&quot;. The malware has a remote controlling function, and attackers sending these emails seem to attempt intruding into the targets&#x27; network using the malware. According to a blog article by Microsoft, the malware is associated with an attacker group identified as &quot;DarkHotel&quot; (Microsoft calls it as &amp;quot;Dubnium&amp;quot;) [1]. This blog entry will introduce the details of Asruex. // Refs.: http://blog.jpcert.or.jp/2016/06/asruex-malware-infecting-through-shortcut-files.html // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/4543238966239955339523.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: Duke APT group&#x27;s latest tools: cloud services and Linux support // Description: Recent weeks have seen the outing of two new additions to the Duke group&#x27;s toolset, SeaDuke and CloudDuke. Of these, SeaDuke is a simple trojan made interesting by the fact that it&#x27;s written in Python. And even more curiously, SeaDuke, with its built-in support for both Windows and Linux, is the first cross-platform malware we have observed from the Duke group. While SeaDuke is a single - albeit cross-platform - trojan, CloudDuke appears to be an entire toolset of malware components, or &quot;solutions&quot; as the Duke group apparently calls them. These components include a unique loader, downloader, and not one but two different trojan components. CloudDuke also greatly expands on the Duke group&#x27;s usage of cloud storage services, specifically Microsoft&#x27;s OneDrive, as a channel for both command and control as well as the exfiltration of stolen data. Finally, some of the recent CloudDuke spear-phishing campaigns have born a striking resemblance to CozyDuke spear-phishing campaigns from a year ago. // Refs.: https://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/00002822.html // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/4262564432922264523685526493.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: The return of HackingTeam with new implants for OS X // Description: Last week, Patrick Wardle published a very nice analysis of a new Backdoor and Dropper used by HackingTeam, which is apparently alive and well. Since HackingTeam implants are built on-demand for each target, we wanted to take a closer look: to see how it works and what its functionality reveals about the possible interest of the attackers behind this latest Backdoor. // Refs.: https://securelist.com/blog/research/74063/the-return-of-hackingteam-with-new-implants-for-os-x/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/5283824492658944955946439234936.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: Operation Ke3chang Resurfaces With New TidePool Malware // Description: Little has been published on the threat actors responsible for Operation Ke3chang since the report was released more than two years ago. However, Unit 42 has recently discovered the actors have continued to evolve their custom malware arsenal. We&#x27;ve discovered a new malware family we&#x27;ve named TidePool. It has strong behavioral ties to Ke3chang and is being used in an ongoing attack campaign against Indian embassy personnel worldwide. This targeting is also consistent with previous attacker TTPs; Ke3chang historically targeted the Ministry of Affairs, and also conducted several prior campaigns against India. // Refs.: http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/05/operation-ke3chang-resurfaces-with-new-tidepool-malware/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/52435952843935945946684398.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: Hellsing APT // Description: The Hellsing APT group is currently active in the APAC region, hitting targets mainly in the South China Sea area, with a focus on Malaysia, the Philippines and Indonesia. The group has a relatively small footprint compared to massive operations such as &quot;Equation&quot;. Smaller groups can have the advantage of being able to stay under the radar for longer periods of time, which is what happened here. // Refs.: https://securelist.com/analysis/publications/69567/the-chronicles-of-the-hellsing-apt-the-empire-strikes-back/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/8494838486854462393564289243569.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: RSA IR: An APT Case Study // Description: This case study contains information from an engagement that the RSA Incident Response (IR) team worked during the September  to  October  2013 timeframe.  It highlights  the  analysis  flow  using  two  of  our  flagship  products,  Security Analytics (SA) and the Enterprise Compromise Assessment Tool (ECAT), for an Advance Persistent Threat (APT) intrusion investigation.    These  key  technologies  allow  RSA  analysts  to  process massive  datasets  and  find  forensically  interesting artifacts in near real-time and more quickly than using standard incident response processes. // Refs.: https://blogs.rsa.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/RSA-IR-Case-Study.pdf // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/36558439245863399665443382.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: Emissary Trojan/ Operation Lotus Blossom Update // Description: In December 2015, Unit 42 published a blog about a cyber espionage attack using the Emissary Trojan as a payload. Emissary is related to the Elise Trojan and the Operation Lotus Blossom attack campaign, which prompted us to start collecting additional samples of Emissary.The oldest sample we found was created in 2009, indicating this tool has been in use for almost seven years. Of note, this is three years earlier than the oldest Elise sample we have found, suggesting this group has been active longer than previously documented. In addition, Emissary appears to only be used against Taiwanese or Hong Kong based targets, all of the decoys are written in Traditional Chinese, and they use themes related to the government or military. // Refs.: http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/02/emissary-trojan-changelog-did-operation-lotus-blossom-cause-it-to-evolve/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/52498963295294343295865438499.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: OPERATION QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT // Description: The first group, named Moafee, appears to operate from the Guandong Province. Its targets include the military organizations and governments of countries with national interests in the South China Sea, including some within the U.S. defense industrial base. Moafee may have chosen its targets based on the rich resources of South China Sea region - the world&#x27;s second business sea-lane, according to Wikipedia - including rare earth metals, crude oil, and natural gas. // Refs.: https://www.fireeye.com/resources/pdfs/white-papers/fireeye-operation-quantum-entanglement.pdf // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/43889692856286986454848954426.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: UPS: Observations on CVE-2015-3113 // Description: A June 23 FireEye blog post titled &quot;Operation Clandestine Wolf&quot; discussed a cyber espionage group, known as APT3, that had been exploiting a zero-day vulnerability in Adobe Flash. Unit 42 also tracks the APT3 group using the name UPS, which is an intrusion set with Chinese origins that is known for having early access to zero-day vulnerabilities and delivering a backdoor called Pirpi. // Refs.: http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2015/07/ups-observations-on-cve-2015-3113-prior-zero-days-and-the-pirpi-payload/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/63843938999926523859452.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: Strider: Cyberespionage group turns eye of Sauron on targets // Description: A previously unknown group called Strider has been conducting cyberespionage-style attacks against selected targets in Russia, China, Sweden, and Belgium. The group uses an advanced piece of malware known as Remsec (Backdoor.Remsec) to conduct its attacks. Remsec is a stealthy tool that appears to be primarily designed for spying purposes. Its code contains a reference to Sauron, the all-seeing antagonist in Lord of the Rings.Strider&#x27;s attacks have tentative links with a previously uncovered group, Flamer. The use of Lua modules, which we&#x27;ll discuss later, is a technique that has previously been used by Flamer. One of Strider&#x27;s targets had also previously been infected by Regin. // Refs.: http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/strider-cyberespionage-group-turns-eye-sauron-targets , http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/Symantec_Remsec_IOCs.pdf , https://securelist.com/files/2016/07/The-ProjectSauron-APT_IOCs_KL.pdf // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/65538835835663554348844393.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: Putter Panda activity // Description: In 2014, our colleagues at Crowdstrike wrote an expose about a long-standing Chinese APT threat group they self-named Putter Panda, which Mandiant/FireEye refers to as APT2. This threat group has been around for quite a while, and commonly operated tangentially to APT1 intrusions into defense contractors and aerospace companies. We&#x27;ve been tracking a series of exploit documents which, upon successful exploitation, simply drop a file and perform no other actions; these documents have dropped a variety of backdoors associated with a range of previously identified threat groups. One of them was of particular interest because we&#x27;d never seen the backdoor before and it leveraged a relatively unique German dynamic DNS provider for command and control. // Refs.: http://blog.cylance.com/puttering-into-the-future // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/46496935822899254924398226.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: Wild Neutron - Economic espionage threat actor returns // Description: A powerful threat actor known as &quot;Wild Neutron&quot; (also known as &quot;Jripbot&quot; and &quot;Morpho&quot;) has been active since at least 2011, infecting high profile companies for several years by using a combination of exploits, watering holes and multi-platform malware.The latest round of attacks in 2015 uses a stolen code signing certificate belonging to Taiwanese electronics maker Acer and an unknown Flash Player exploit.Wild Neutron hit the spotlight in 2013, when it successfully infected companies such as Apple, Facebook, Twitter and Microsoft. This attack took advantage of a Java zero-day exploit and used hacked forums as watering holes. The 2013 incident was highly publicized and, in the aftermath, the threat actor went dark for almost one year. // Refs.: https://securelist.com/blog/research/71275/wild-neutron-economic-espionage-threat-actor-returns-with-new-tricks/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/6559448495634393264424654865445.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: Threat Group-3390 Targets Organizations for Cyberespionage // Description: Dell SecureWorks Counter Threat Unit(TM) (CTU) researchers investigated activities associated with Threat Group-3390[1] (TG-3390). Analysis of TG-3390&#x27;s operations, targeting, and tools led CTU researchers to assess with moderate confidence the group is located in the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The threat actors target a wide range of organizations: CTU researchers have observed TG-3390 actors obtaining confidential data on defense manufacturing projects, but also targeting other industry verticals and attacking organizations involved in international relations. The group extensively uses long-running strategic web compromises[2] (SWCs), and relies on whitelists to deliver payloads to select victims. In comparison to other threat groups, TG-3390 is notable for its tendency to compromise Microsoft Exchange servers using a custom backdoor and credential logger. // Refs.: http://www.secureworks.com/cyber-threat-intelligence/threats/threat-group-3390-targets-organizations-for-cyberespionage/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/53623326955238425934369326.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: A Look Into Fysbis: Sofacy&#x27;s Linux Backdoor // Description: The Sofacy group, also known as APT28 and Sednit, is a fairly well known cyber espionage group believed to have ties to Russia. Their targets have spanned all across the world, with a focus on government, defense organizations and various Eastern European governments. From these reports, we know that the group uses an abundance of tools and tactics, ranging across zero-day exploits targeting common applications such as Java or Microsoft Office, heavy use of spear-phishing attacks, compromising legitimate websites to stage watering-hole attacks, and targeting over a variety of operating systems - Windows, OSX, Linux, even mobile iOS. // Refs.: http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/02/a-look-into-fysbis-sofacys-linux-backdoor // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/95324666665622322459395294543.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: KOVTER and CERBER on a One-Two Punch using Fake Delivery Notification // Description: We previously outlined a spam campaign that delivered FAKEGLOBE and CERBER ransomwares. This week the spam party did not just include CERBER, but also decided to invite an old friend - the KOVTER family. In 2015, KOVTER, a click-fraud malware, made headlines when it used a file-less technique similar to the POWERLIKS trojan. The KOVTER malware embeds a JavaScript into the registry and executes a PowerShell script which eventually loads the main KOVTER binaries. This kind of persistence has made it difficult for security vendors to detect the malware. // Refs.: https://www.trustwave.com/Resources/SpiderLabs-Blog/KOVTER-and-CERBER-on-a-One-Two-Punch-using-Fake-Delivery-Notification/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/3882445996568656855926.json</div>

A good example is provided by Turla&#x27;s watering hole campaigns. Turla, which has been targeting governments, government officials and diplomats for years - see, as an example, this recent paper - is still using watering hole techniques to redirect potentially interesting victims to their C&amp;amp;C infrastructure. In fact, they have been using them since at least 2014 with very few variations in their modus operandi. // Refs.: https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/06/06/turlas-watering-hole-campaign-updated-firefox-extension-abusing-instagram/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/4332625594596328526262835624426492.json</div>

The backdoor Trojan authors have called it XAgentOSX, which shares the name XAgent with one of Sofacy&#x27;s Windows-based Trojan and references Apple&#x27;s previous name for macOS, OS X. It appears the same actor developed both the Komplex and XAgentOSX tools, based on similarities within the following project paths found within the tools. // Refs.: http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2017/02/unit42-xagentosx-sofacys-xagent-macos-tool/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/56655324385584953558828564385224.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: CARBANAK GROUP USES GOOGLE FOR MALWARE COMMAND-AND-CONTROL // Description: Forcepoint Security Labs(tm) recently investigated a trojanized RTF document which we tied to the Carbank criminal gang. The document contains an encoded Visual Basic Script (VBScript) typical of previous Carbanak malware. Recent samples of the malware have now included the ability to use Google services for command-and-control (C&amp;amp;C) communication. We have notified Google of the abuse and are working with them to share additional information.Carbanak (also known as Anunak) are a group of financially motivated criminals first exposed in 2015. The actors typically steal from financial institutions using targeted malware. Recently a new Carbanak attack campaign dubbed &amp;quot;Digital Plagiarist&amp;quot; was exposed where the group used weaponized office documents hosted on mirrored domains, in order to distribute malware. // Refs.: https://blogs.forcepoint.com/security-labs/carbanak-group-uses-google-malware-command-and-control // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/58898568934694865442848822442.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: Lurk: Retracing the Group&#x27;s Five-Year Campaign // Description: The cybercriminal group Lurk was one of the first to effectively employ fileless infection techniques in large-scale attacks--techniques that arguably became staples for other malefactors. A typical Lurk infection uses browser exploits to deliver non-persistent payloads to potential victims, probing their targets before deploying additional malware. The infection chain had multiple stages, and was accomplished using bodiless/fileless exploit payloads executed in-memory without additional persistence mechanisms. No traces were left on affected systems apart from files from the exploit process if the target machine wasn&#x27;t interesting to the Lurk operators. This eponymous lurking behavior would earn them notoriety until their operations were stymied and the perpetrators arrested. Lurk was believed to have siphoned over $45 million from financial organizations, ultimately disrupting the victims&#x27; operations, reputation, and bottom line. // Refs.: http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/lurk-retracing-five-year-campaign/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/894262334565986625844869396852.json</div>

Apart from infecting systems withit, we also spotted instances where common lateral movement tools were detected around thesame time they were actively compromising the endpoint with MajikPOS. These tools include:HKTL_MIMIKATZ, HKTL_FGDUMP, and HKTL_VNCPASSVIEW. We surmise that the badguys attempted to gain further access within the victim&#x27;s network. In separate isolated incidents,we also noticed the deployment of MajikPOS via PsExec, a command-line tool that can be usedto remotely execute processes on other systems. This may indicate that valid, administrative levelcredentials were used against the host. The attackers also tend to deploy what works orwhat&amp;#39;s convenient, as we&#x27;ve also seen them attempt to infect the target host with other PoSmalware such as PwnPOS (TSPY_PWNPOS.SMA), and BlackPOS (TSPY_POCARDL.AI). // Refs.: http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/majikpos-combines-pos-malware-and-rats/ , https://documents.trendmicro.com/assets/majikpos-combines-pos-malware-and-rats-to-pull-off-its-malicious-tricks.pdf // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/4586839849638294986648224925.json</div>
