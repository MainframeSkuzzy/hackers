<div id='otxpost'> Name: Investigation of Linux.Mirai Trojan family // Description: A Trojan for Linux that was named Linux.Mirai has several predecessors. The first malware program belongingto this family was spotted in May 2016 and was dubbed Linux.DDoS.87. At the beginning ofAugust, a new version of this Trojan--Linux.DDoS.89--was discovered. Finally, Doctor Web&#x27;s securityresearchers investigated the Linux.Mirai Trojan found later that month. // Refs.: https://st.drweb.com/static/new-www/news/2016/september/Investigation_of_Linux.Mirai_Trojan_family_en.pdf // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/49342434236653822299442856282.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: An analysis of exploit supply chains and digital quartermasters // Description: On July 5, 2015 an unknown hacker publicly announced on Twitter that he had breached the internal network of Hacking Team - an Italian pentesting company known to purchase 0-day exploits and produce their own trojans. The hacker proceeded to leak archives of internal Hacking Team tools and communications. A number of tools and previously unknown exploits were discovered in the trove of data posted online. In the attached paper we will focus on two exploits which at the time of discovery in the Hacking Team archives were unpatched. The two 0-days in question targeted Adobe Flash and were subsequently labeled CVE-2015-5119 and CVE-2015-5122. // Refs.: http://blog.shadowserver.org/2015/08/10/the-italian-connection-an-analysis-of-exploit-supply-chains-and-digital-quartermasters/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/2459384466893668343636262925598242693524.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: Ostap Bender: 400 Ways to Make the Population Part With Their Money // Description: In late October, Proofpoint researchers identified and began tracking a financially-motivated threat actor group with access to banking Trojans and other malware, including Dridex, Ursnif, Tinba, and the point-of-sale (POS) malware AbaddonPOS with its loader, TinyLoader. More significantly, the group also uses a previously undocumented JScript backdoor called &quot;Ostap&quot; and a Delphi dropper we named &quot;MrWhite&quot;. MrWhite can profile the victim systems for the presence of running POS software before dropping further POS payloads. Adding this extra layer of filtering may help the group focus on targets of interest and evade detection due to use of known malware.So far, these campaigns have targeted countries including Germany, Austria, and the United Kingdom. While vertical targeting varies, we observed a significant focus on Financial Services. // Refs.: https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/ostap-bender-400-ways-make-population-part-with-their-money // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/96452588564464258688.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: Real News, Fake Flash Mac OS X Users Targeted // Description: Volexity recently identified a breach to the website of a well regarded media outlet in the country of Georgia. As part of this breach, the media organization&#x27;s website was being leveraged as a component of a malware campaign targeting select visitors. The news organization provides reporting on its website in English, Georgian, and Russian. However, only the Georgian language portion of the website was impacted and used in an effort to distribute malware. The targets were then further narrowed to those that were running the Mac OS X operating system, had not previously visited the website, and had specific browser versions. The attackers accomplished much of this with JavaScript they placed on the media organization&#x27;s website. // Refs.: https://www.volexity.com/blog/2017/07/24/real-news-fake-flash-mac-os-x-users-targeted/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/2399323368999669235654898.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: Android trojan drops in, despite Google Bouncer // Description: We at ESET recently discovered an interesting stealth attack on Android users, an app that is a regular game but with one interesting addition: the application was bundled with another application with the name systemdata or resourcea and that&#x27;s certainly a bit fishy. Why would a regular game downloaded from the official Google Play store come with another application named systemdata? This particular application/game from Google Play Store is certainly not a system application, as the name seems intended to suggest.The packaged application is dropped silently onto the device but has to ask the user to actually install it. The app requesting the installation is passed off as a &#x27;Manage Settings&#x27; app. After installation, the application runs in the background as service.ESET detects the games that install the Trojan as Android/TrojanDropper.Mapin and the Trojan itself as Android/Mapin. // Refs.: http://www.welivesecurity.com/2015/09/22/android-trojan-drops-in-despite-googles-bouncer/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/352442389268282398499869528.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: Tomcat IR with XOR.DDoS // Description: Apache Tomcat is a java based web service that is used for different applications. While you may have it running in your environment, you may not be familiar with its workings to provide adequate incident response  when the time come. This article will walk through an incident where Tomcat is used and what critical artifacts you should collect. // Refs.: https://isc.sans.edu/diary/Tomcat+IR+with+XOR.DDoS/20721 // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/883536584654424989223895.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: Grabit and the RATs // Description: Not so long ago, Kaspersky clients in the United States approached Kaspersky researchers with a request to investigate a new type of malicious software that they were able to recover from their organizations&#x27; servers. The malware calls itself Grabit and is distinctive because of its versatile behavior. Every sample we found was different in size and activity from the others but the internal name and other identifiers were disturbingly similar. The timestamp seems valid and close to the documented infection timeline. Our documentation points to a campaign that started somewhere in late February 2015 and ended in mid-March. As the development phase supposedly ended, malware started spreading from India, the United States and Israel to other countries around the globe. // Refs.: https://securelist.com/blog/research/70087/grabit-and-the-rats/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/9868344422858499528425839.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: Orcus - Birth of an unusual plugin builder RAT // Description: Unit 42 has been tracking a new Remote Access Trojan (RAT) being sold for $40 USD since April 2016, known as &quot;Orcus&quot;. Though Orcus has all the typical features of RAT malware, it allows users to build custom plugins and also has a modular architecture for better management and scalability. The objective of this blog is to highlight some of the capabilities of this new RAT family and the impact seen so far. // Refs.: http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/08/unit42-orcus-birth-of-an-unusual-plugin-builder-rat/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/955234956843258359295495223.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: EternalMiner Copycats exploiting SambaCry for cryptocurrency mining // Description: About eight weeks ago, a critical RCE vulnerability present in every Samba version since 2010 was reported and patched.  This vulnerability is mostly known as &quot;SambaCry&quot; after the famous WannaCry attack targeting Windows systems vulnerable to &quot;EternalBlue&quot; SMB exploit. The vulnerability lies in a logical bug, which enables an attacker with write-only access to a share to load a malicious samba module and execute arbitrary code. // Refs.: http://www.intezer.com/eternalminer-copycats/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/24633993533666352932868694949663.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: PhishTank - Dynamic List of Verified/Online IRS (Internal Revenue Service) Phishing URLs // Description: This is an automated process that is updated hourly by the Vertek MTI Labs Team.

<div id='otxpost'> Name: Insider Information: An intrusion campaign targeting Chinese language news sites // Description: This report reveals a campaign of reconnaissance, phishing, and malware operations that use content and domains made to mimic Chinese language news websites.CitizenLab connect the infrastructure used in the campaign to previous malware operations targeting a Tibetan radio station and the Thai government. We also connect one of the code signing certificates we observed to a campaign targeting gaming companies. It is notable that NetWire was also used as a payload in that campaign. // Refs.: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/citizenlab/malware-indicators/master/201707_InsiderInfo/indicators.csv , https://citizenlab.org/2017/07/insider-information-an-intrusion-campaign-targeting-chinese-language-news-sites/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/44683992926924328488298695698529865.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: Defaulting on Passwords (Part 1): r0_bot // Description: Early in March, while studying the ChinaZ threat, it became readily apparent that default passwords were being used for more than just a supplementary attack vector. Several bots relied heavily, if not exclusively, on systems with weak and/or default passwords to spread. We setup a system with weak and default passwords to capture any and all malware spread in this fashion. For this first test, I selected 5 sets of passwords; admin/admin, guest/guest, ubnt/ubnt, cisco/cisco and ADMIN/ADMIN (the last for picking up folks scanning for Supermicro IPMI devices). Unsurprisingly, it took just under 3 hours for the first infection to hit. What did surprise us though was what password combination was first to be hit; ubnt/ubnt. // Refs.: http://blog.cari.net/carisirt-defaulting-on-passwords-part-1-r0_bot/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/3943894899845533633699226.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: TREASUREHUNT: A CUSTOM POS MALWARE TOOL // Description: Since early 2015, FireEye Threat Intelligence has observed the significant growth of point-of-sale (POS) malware families in underground cyber crime forums. POS malware refers to malicious software that extracts payment card information from memory and usually uploads that data to a command and control (CnC) server.In this article FireEye examines TREASUREHUNT, POS malware that appears to have been custom-built for the operations of a particular &quot;dump shop,&quot; which sells stolen credit card data. TREASUREHUNT enumerates running processes, extracts payment card information from memory, and then transmits this information to a command and control server. // Refs.: https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2016/03/treasurehunt_a_cust.html // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/924342855924498292238332426.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: BEBLOH Expands to Japan in Latest Spam Attack // Description: An old banking Trojan has been operating in Europe on a low level has spiked in activity after migrating to Japan. Cybercriminals are using local brand names such as local ISP providers and legitimate looking addresses to fool users into downloading malware that can steal information by monitoring browsers, file transfer protocol (FTP) clients, and mail clients. Its targets? Mostly rural banks.BEBLOH is a banking Trojan that has been around since as early as 2009. It has outlived several competitors including Zeus, and SpyEye. It is designed to steal money from unsuspecting victims right off their bank accounts without them even noticing. BEBLOH always came up with new defensive measures to avoid AV products, and this time is no different. BEBLOH is also known for hiding in memory and creating a temporary new executable file upon shutdown, and deleting said file after re-infecting the system. // Refs.: http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/bebloh-expands-japan-latest-spam-attack/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/68486224394338484329936426634549.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: Odinaff: New Trojan used in high level financial attacks // Description: Since January 2016, discreet campaigns involving malware called Trojan.Odinaff have targeted a number of financial organizations worldwide. These attacks appear to be extremely focused on organizations operating in the banking, securities, trading, and payroll sectors. Organizations who provide support services to these industries are also of interest.Odinaff is typically deployed in the first stage of an attack, to gain a foothold onto the network, providing a persistent presence and the ability to install additional tools onto the target network. These additional tools bear the hallmarks of a sophisticated attacker which has plagued the financial industry since at least 2013-Carbanak. This new wave of attacks has also used some infrastructure that has previously been used in Carbanak campaigns. // Refs.: http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/odinaff-new-trojan-used-high-level-financial-attacks // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/6235636829392845823683649898546.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: Magic Hound Campaign Attacks Saudi Targets // Description: Unit 42 has discovered a persistent attack campaign operating primarily in the Middle East dating back to at least mid-2016 which we have named Magic Hound. This appears to be an attack campaign focused on espionage. Based upon our visibility it has primarily targeted organizations in the energy, government, and technology sectors that are either in in or business interests in Saudi Arabia. The adversaries appear to have evolved their tactics and techniques throughout the tracked time-period, iterating through a diverse toolset across different waves of attacks. Link analysis of infrastructure and tools also revealed a potential relationship between Magic Hound and the adversary group called &quot;Rocket Kitten&quot; (AKA Operation Saffron Rose, Ajax Security Team, Operation Woolen-Goldfish) as well as an older attack campaign called Newscasters. // Refs.: http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2017/02/unit42-magic-hound-campaign-attacks-saudi-targets/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/28968589956339392834584922.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: Carbanak gang is back and packing new guns // Description: The Carbanak financial APT group made the headlines when Group-IB and Fox-IT broke the news in December 2014, followed by the Kaspersky report in February 2015. The two reports describe the same cybercriminal gang which stole up to several hundreds of millions of dollars from various financial institutions.However, the story is interesting not only because of the large amount of money stolen but also from a technical point of view. The Carbanak team does not just blindly compromise large numbers of computers and try to &#x27;milk the cow&#x27; as other actors do, instead they act like a mature APT-group. They only compromise specific high-value targets and once inside the company networks, move laterally to hosts that can be monetized. // Refs.: http://www.welivesecurity.com/2015/09/08/carbanak-gang-is-back-and-packing-new-guns/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/52342689348539326463869.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: Sakula Reloaded // Description: Sakula is a well known malware variant linked to several significant targeted intrusion campaigns over the past 2-3 years. This remote access toolkit has been publicly examined multiple times by the threat intelligence community. CrowdStrike has released two blog posts detailing Sakula campaigns and continues to investigate its usage. In the past two years, two campaigns of Sakula activity stand out as being particularly significant - the &quot;French Aerospace&quot; Campaign and the &quot;Ironman&quot; Campaign. In recent months, CrowdStrike has observed limited use of what appears to be a third Sakula variant. // Refs.: http://blog.crowdstrike.com/sakula-reloaded/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/24393633445639554946233596.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: Operation Iron Tiger // Description: Key individuals, who are believed to be part of a China-based attack group, have been stealing years of valuable government and corporate information from defense and high technology organizations in the US since 2013 and political and government-related entities in China, Hong Kong, and the Philippines since 2010.This shift in targets is highly notable for the active cyber espionage operation we dubbed as &quot;Operation Iron Tiger.&quot; We believe that the threat actors have simply moved up in the food chain and were assigned new, high-level targets to spy on-all as part of a bigger espionage campaign.US defense contractors were only fairly recent targets based on the operation&#x27;s history, which we traced to spear-phishing in 2010. &quot;Foreign policy,&quot; &quot;future of the US Army Officer Corps,&quot; and &quot;economic development&quot; are only a few of the keywords that threat actors have been using in spear-phishing attacks against directors and project managers of technology-inclined US government contractors. // Refs.: http://www.trendmicro.com/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/white-papers/wp-operation-iron-tiger.pdf , http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/operation-iron-tiger-how-china-based-actors-shifted-attacks-from-apac-to-us-targets/ , http://documents.trendmicro.com/assets/pdf/operation-iron-tiger-appendix.pdf // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/385644988289484829455238942242.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: Hancitor Downloader Spam Runs // Description: Hancitor is one of the better-known malware downloaders due to its numerous SPAM runs and evolving delivery technique. It reminds us of Upatre, which gained notoriety status over the past two years but has now died down, possibly due to the takedowns of its major payloads. In the case of Hancitor, it still seen as a favourite carrier of very much active malware families such as Pony and Vawtrak.Just recently, we found a new spam campaign of Hancitor with some notable developments that may have been in the previous variants, but were not discussed in any other reports. This article revolves around the macro tricks it uses to stall analysts, and new commands that it utilizes to better persist on infected devices. Finally, this variant also contains an interesting piece of comment by the malware author written in the macro code, which made us feel obliged to take a closer look in the first place. // Refs.: https://blog.fortinet.com/2016/11/02/the-angry-spam-and-the-tricky-macro-delivers-updated-hancitor , https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/portal/Threat/Encyclopedia/Entry.aspx?Name=TrojanDownloader:Win32/Zdowbot.C // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/2355633998325625943424288882.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: Sakula Malware Family // Description: Dell SecureWorks Counter Threat Unit(TM) (CTU) researchers analyzed multiple versions of a remote access trojan (RAT) named Sakula (also known as Sakurel and VIPER). The RAT, which according to compile timestamps first surfaced in November 2012, has been used in targeted intrusions through 2015. Sakula enables an adversary to run interactive commands as well as to download and execute additional components.Sakula uses HTTP GET and POST communication for command and control (C2). Network communication is obfuscated with single-byte XOR encoding. Sakula also leverages single-byte XOR encoding to obfuscate various strings and files embedded in the resource section, which are subsequently used for User Account Control (UAC) bypass on both 32 and 64-bit systems. Most samples maintain persistence through a registry Run key, although some samples configure themselves as a service. // Refs.: http://www.secureworks.com/cyber-threat-intelligence/threats/sakula-malware-family/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/29985543422244665963624252298254.json</div>

We took a look at the malware specifically in the INOCNATION campaign to analyze what was new and different about the techniques used by the threat actor. It appears the entity behind this campaign took steps to make reverse engineering more difficult and chose the use of Cisco&#x27;s AnyConnect Client as a lure to trick victims into installing the malware.The RAT delivered by this campaign was not particularly interesting and had all the features you would expect in such a tool. The use of the obfuscation techniques was novel and this advisory discusses those in detail, along with how we detected them. // Refs.: https://www.fidelissecurity.com/sites/default/files/FTA_1020_Fidelis_Inocnation_FINAL.pdf , http://www.threatgeek.com/2015/12/fidelis-threat-advisory-1020-dissecting-the-malware-involved-in-the-inocnation-campaign.html // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/89642393868938882353946594389.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: Scarlet Mimic: Espionage Campaign Targets Minority Activists // Description: Over the past seven months, Unit 42 has been investigating a series of attacks we attribute to a group we have code named &quot;Scarlet Mimic.&quot; The attacks began over four years ago and their targeting pattern suggests that this adversary&#x27;s primary mission is to gather information about minority rights activists. We do not have evidence directly linking these attacks to a government source, but the information derived from these activities supports an assessment that a group or groups with motivations similar to the stated position of the Chinese government in relation to these targets is involved.The attacks we attribute to Scarlet Mimic have primarily targeted Uyghur and Tibetan activists as well as those who are interested in their causes. Both the Tibetan community and the Uyghurs, a Turkic Muslim minority residing primarily in northwest China, have been targets of multiple sophisticated attacks in the past decade. // Refs.: http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/01/scarlet-mimic-years-long-espionage-targets-minority-activists/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/5829648884664486662923482.json</div>

The nature and geographic spread of the targets seems to point to a sponsor, or sponsors, with regional, political interests. The attackers, whom we have named Packrat, have shown a keen and systematic interest in the political opposition and the independent press in so-called ALBA countries (Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas), and their recently allied regimes. These countries are linked by a trade agreement as well as a cooperation on a range of non-financial matters. // Refs.: https://github.com/citizenlab/malware-signatures/blob/master/packrat/domains.csv , https://github.com/citizenlab/malware-signatures/blob/master/packrat/md5-c2.csv , https://citizenlab.org/2015/12/packrat-report/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/3568835395299939864532926.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: Microsoft Office OLE2Link vulnerability samples - a quick triage // Description: On April 7th 2017 Haifei Li published on the McAfee blog1 about a &quot;Critical Office Zero-Day&quot; in the wild. Few details weregiven and no hashes were available, which made it interesting to find samples and conduct an initial analysis. A further blog by FireEye titled &quot;Acknowledgement of Attacks Leveraging Microsoft Zero-Day&quot; provided additional useful information.During testing we were able to generate a number of proof-of-concept (PoC) documents both with and without a prompt to the user. It is likely the vulnerability will be documented in full detail over the coming days. Therefore we instead discuss a number of ways to detect and analyse these documents using freely available tools.

<div id='otxpost'> Name: Report on North Korean cyber attacks // Description: In February 2016, Novetta announced a profiling report entitled &amp;quot;Operation Blockbuster: Unraveling the Long Thread of Sony Attack&amp;quot; in association with global security companies (Kaspersky Lab, Symantec, Trend Micro, JPCERT / CC, etc.). The Lazarus group, which has been identified as the backbone of the report, has been active in the past, and Novetta &amp;#39;s research is helping to preemptively counteract and prevent Lazarus attacks around the world. However, global security companies are limited in collecting attack information in Korea, and there is also a lack of information about the attacks that Lazarus or Lazarus are suspected of as a small group of threat groups in Korea. Therefore, the Korea Financial Supervisory Service (KFAS) identified the specific characteristics of domestic IT and work environment, and profiled specific threat groups that are using the attacks. The results are described in this report. // Refs.: http://www.fsec.or.kr/common/proc/fsec/bbs/21/fileDownLoad/1235.do // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/4833226533882325884342824.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: New Carbanak / Anunak Attack Methodology // Description: In the last month Trustwave was engaged by two separate hospitality clients, and one restaurant chain for investigations by an unknown attacker or attackers. The modus operandi for all three investigations were very similar and appear to be a new Carbanak gang attack methodology, focused on the hospitality industry. Carbanak is a prolific crime group, well known for stealing over one billion dollars from banks in 2015 (*Kaspersky estimated loss) and more recently orchestrating an attack on the Oracle Micros POS support site that put over one million Point of Sale systems at risk. The current investigations are still underway but the known indicators of compromise in these new attacks will be presented below. At the time of investigation this malware was not correctly detected by any existing antivirus engines, and domains / IP&amp;#39;s were not found in any commercial threat intelligence feeds. // Refs.: https://www.trustwave.com/Resources/SpiderLabs-Blog/New-Carbanak-/-Anunak-Attack-Methodology/?page=1&amp;amp;year=0&amp;amp;month=0 // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/824394428999696266334922245948.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: New XM1RPC SEO Spam and Backdoor Campaign // Description: We have been monitoring a new campaign specifically targeting WordPress sites, using hundreds of them for SEO spam distribution. We call it the XM1RPC campaign due to the common backdoor used across all of the compromised sites.The file is named in such a way as to confuse WordPress administrators who are familiar with XML-RPC.  This malware usually infects all sites that share the same FTP account, which means cleaning just one website won&#x27;t help as hackers use the compromised site to reinfect all sites on the server in a matter of minutes. // Refs.: https://blog.sucuri.net/2016/11/xm1rpc-spam-backdoor.html // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/2249544894635232282669.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: The Naikon APT // Description: The Naikon APT aligns with the actor our colleagues at FireEye recently revealed to be APT30, but we haven&#x27;t discovered any exact matches. It is hardly surprising that there is an element of overlap, considering both actors have for years mined victims in the South China Sea area, apparently in search of geo-political intelligence. // Refs.: https://securelist.com/analysis/publications/69953/the-naikon-apt/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/43982585629939345399839884593935.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: MARCHER GETS CLOSE TO USERS BY TARGETING MOBILE BANKING, ANDROID APPS, SOCIAL MEDIA, AND EMAIL // Description: Marcher inspects its infected devices carefully by using a dedicated, hard-coded configuration in each Android Package Kit (APK), Google&#x27;s file format for distributing and installing application software (like mobile banking apps) on the Android OS. Each APK has the ability to target different financial institutions in specific geographical locations.F5 research conducted in March 2017 followed 153 Marcher configuration files to uncover target and activity trends in the worldwide attack campaigns. Among the 153 configuration files, 54 distinct command and control (C&amp;amp;C) servers were detected. Of the 54 distinct C&amp;amp;C servers, 12 of them were online and operational (until F5 had them shut down in March), 10 were sink-holed, and 32 were already offline. The remaining 99 C&amp;amp;C servers were duplicated configurations from different APKs. This is likely due to configuration files being hardcoded within the APK, and old spam campaigns infecting different users, thus, old configurations still being detected in the wild. // Refs.: https://f5.com/labs/articles/threat-intelligence/malware/marcher-gets-close-to-users-by-targeting-mobile-banking-android-apps-social-media-and-email-26004 // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/862485458369946496288862439.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: MalumPoS: Targets Hotels and other US Industries // Description: TrendMicro first discovered MalumPoS, a new attack tool that threat actors can reconfigure to breach any PoS system they wish to target. Currently, it is designed to collect data from PoS systems running on Oracle(r) MICROS(r), a platform popularly used in the hospitality, food and beverage, and retail industries.MalumPoS was designed to be configurable. This means that in the future, the threat actor can change or add other processes or targets. He can, for example, configure MalumPoS to include Radiant or NCR Counterpoint PoS systems to its target list. With that inclusion, companies running on those systems will also be at risk. // Refs.: http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/trend-micro-discovers-malumpos-targets-hotels-and-other-us-industries/ , http://documents.trendmicro.com/images/tex/pdf/MalumPOS%20Technical%20Brief.pdf // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/358849855326294236633495855.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: MALWARE POSING AS HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS AND COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE TARGETING IRANIANS AND FOREIGN POLICY INSTITUTIONS // Description: On August 4, 2016, the Gmail account of an unknown individual was compromised in order to conduct spearphishing campaigns against a diverse set of targets related to Iran. The spearphishing attempt posed as a message from the Director of United for Iran, a U.S.-based human rights organization, claiming that the organization had developed a secure communications tool for activists. The message was sent from an account created under her name on lesser known email provider (1&amp;amp;1&#x27;s Mail.com), a common tactic in recent months, with a link to a file hosted on Dropbox and an additional credential phishing attempt. Once the observed Gmail account was under their control, the actors then forwarded malware to over a hundred of their contacts, ranging from an address for the United Nations Refugee Agency in Turkey to a site contact for Reza Pahlavi, the son of the deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. // Refs.: https://iranthreats.github.io/resources/human-rights-impersonation-malware/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/438536325523956889.json</div>

However, Unit 42 has recently discovered the actors have continued to evolve their custom malware arsenal. We&#x27;ve discovered a new malware family we&#x27;ve named TidePool. It has strong behavioral ties to Ke3chang and is being used in an ongoing attack campaign against Indian embassy personnel worldwide. This targeting is also consistent with previous attacker TTPs; Ke3chang historically targeted the Ministry of Affairs, and also conducted several prior campaigns against India. // Refs.: http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/05/operation-ke3chang-resurfaces-with-new-tidepool-malware/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/52435952843935945946684398.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: T9000: Advanced Modular Backdoor Uses Complex Anti-Analysis // Description: Most custom backdoors used by advanced attackers have limited functionality. They evade detection by keeping their code simple and flying under the radar. But during a recent investigation we found a backdoor that takes a very different approach. We refer to this backdoor as T9000, which is a newer variant of the T5000 malware family, also known as Plat1.In addition to the basic functionality all backdoors provide, T9000 allows the attacker to capture encrypted data, take screenshots of specific applications and specifically target Skype users. The malware goes to great lengths to identify a total of 24 potential security products that may be running on a system and customizes its installation mechanism to specifically evade those that are installed. It uses a multi-stage installation process with specific checks at each point to identify if it is undergoing analysis by a security researcher.The primary functionality of this tool is to gather information about the victim. // Refs.: http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/02/t9000-advanced-modular-backdoor-uses-complex-anti-analysis-techniques/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/36389935983936293448232446229.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: FastPOS Updates in Time for the Retail Sale Season // Description: Most point-of-sale (PoS) threats follow a common process: dump, scrape, store, exfiltrate. FastPOS (initially detected by Trend Micro as TSPY_FASTPOS.SMZTDA) was different with the way it removed a middleman and went straight from stealing credit card data to directly exfiltrating them to its command and control (C&amp;amp;C) servers.FastPOS was true to its moniker--pilfer data as fast as possible, as much as it can, even at the expense of stealth. The malware is a reflection of how PoS threats, though no longer novel, are increasingly used against businesses and their customers. As such, FastPOS&#x27;s update does not come as a surprise--in time for the oncoming retail season to boot. // Refs.: http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/fastpos-updates-in-time-for-retail-sale-season/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/535359264226654683544862864339446965.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: Dridex actors distributing the Shifu banking Trojan // Description: Following a month-long hiatus after a number of arrests, and despite a recent reported takedown, Dridex actors appear to have taken the recent disruptions as a challenge to bounce back better than ever. Proofpoint researchers analyzed the activity in the recent return to operations of the Dridex actors and identified numerous changes in behavior, from technical innovations to distributing other banking and data-stealing malware. // Refs.: https://proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/Not-Yet-Dead // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/56699492825523358666949289386.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: Teaching an old RAT new tricks // Description: Recently we detected a more sophisticated technique that a handful of countries across Asia are actively using to infect systems with RATs.  This new technique ensures that the payload/file remains in memory through its execution, never touching the disk in a de-encrypted state.  In doing so, the attacker can remain out of view from antivirus technologies, and even &#x27;next-generation&#x27; technologies that only focus on file-based threat vectors.  Also, the samples analyzed have the ability detect the presence of a virtual machine to ensure it&#x27;s not being analyzed in a network sandbox.And finally it&#x27;s important to highlight that the RAT itself is not new. // Refs.: https://www.sentinelone.com/blogs/teaching-an-old-rat-new-tricks/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/683263385648448865254264268.json</div>

Whether this is a permanent return to locky or a one off, I don&#x27;t know at this stage, but Locky have vanished for while before &amp;amp; returned. // Refs.: https://myonlinesecurity.co.uk/the-return-of-locky-with-fake-invoice-emails/ , http://blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/06/necurs-locky-campaign.html // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/95425392644883356833239865.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: NetTraveler APT Targets Russian, European Interests // Description: Throughout 2016, Proofpoint researchers tracked a cyber-espionage campaign targeting victims in Russia and neighboring countries. The actor utilizes spear phishing campaigns to deliver NetTraveler, also known as TravNet. First observed as early as 2004, NetTraveler is a Trojan used widely in targeted attacks. We believe that this attacker operates out of China. In addition to Russia, targeted regions include neighboring countries such as Mongolia, Belarus, and other European countries. The spear-phishing campaigns we detected use links to RAR-compressed executables and Microsoft Word attachments that exploit the CVE-2012-0158 vulnerability.This particular APT is targeting organizations that include weapons manufacturers, human rights activists, and pro-democracy groups, among others. // Refs.: https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/nettraveler-apt-targets-russian-european-interests // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/93428453553929869223833388532542.json</div>

<div id='otxpost'> Name: Moonlight - Targeted attacks in the Middle East // Description: Vectra Threat Labs researchers have uncovered the activities of a group of individuals currently engaged in targeted attacks against entities in the Middle East. We identified over two hundred samples of malware generated by the group over the last two years. These attacks are themed around Middle Eastern political issues and the motivation appears to relate to espionage, as opposed to opportunistic or criminal intentions.These are not technically sophisticated attackers. However, they do deploy some novel tactics, detailed below, and the implications of these attacks could be significant. Both the tools and targets of Moonlight are reminiscent of &quot;Gaza Hacker Team,&quot; a group of attackers that are said to be politically aligned to the Hamas[1]. In spite of these commonalities, we have not identified any firm links between the two groups.We refer to this group of attackers as Moonlight, after the name the attackers chose for one of their command-and-control domains. // Refs.: http://blog.vectranetworks.com/blog/moonlight-middle-east-targeted-attacks // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/649986383658884292696.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: Flying Dragon Eye: Uyghur Themed Threat Activity // Description: This paper documents attempted exploitation activity aimed at Uyghur interests outside of China. Exploitation is being attempted via the usual tactic of spear phishing containing malicious attachments to targets. The exploit code attached used for dropping the malware is older - CVE-2012-0158 - and from our vantage point, we have no indication of successful or failed exploitation. Nonetheless, we can obtain targeting information and insight into tactics from the spearphish messages used by the threat actors. Successful exploitation typically results in malware calling back to one or more Uyghur themed domain names. The malware payloads observed to be associated with the Uyghur themed C2 domains so far consist of PlugX, Gh0st RAT, and Saker/Xbox, although there may be others that are yet to be discovered. // Refs.: https://www.arbornetworks.com/blog/asert/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/TLP-WHITE-Flying-Dragon-Eye-Uyghur-Themed-Threat-Activity.pdf // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/494956522456355543549598365.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: Data-Stealing NionSpy File Infector // Description: W32/NionSpy is a family of malware that steals information from infected machines and replicates to new machines over networks and removable thumb drives. Aside from stealing keystrokes, passwords, Bitcoins, system information, and files on disk, NionSpy (also known as Mewsei and MewsSpy) can record video (using the webcam), audio (using the microphone), take screenshots, and use infected machines as a proxy tunnel to connect to other machines within the network. // Refs.:  // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/383435456888236854932255998663526.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: Rovnix Downloader Updated with SinkHole and Time Checks // Description: McAfee Labs has found that the latest Rovnix downloader now comes with the capability to check for the sinkholing of its control servers. This relatively new technique makes it difficult to detect the malware--especially on behavior-based malware detection systems. The malware checks for sinkholing of its control servers before each network communication session and does not initiate its malicious activities--such as downloading and running the malicious payload(s)--if it thinks the Domain Name Service (DNS) records have been sinkholed. The downloader also uses an uncommon technique to perform a timing check to decide whether it should perform its malicious activities. // Refs.: https://blogs.mcafee.com/mcafee-labs/rovnix-downloader-sinkhole-time-checks/ // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/8459349262369526564589662239425.json</div>
<div id='otxpost'> Name: Privileges and Credentials: Phished at the Request of Counsel // Description: In May and June 2017, FireEye observed a phishing campaign targeting at least seven global law and investment firms. We have associated this campaign with APT19, a group that we assess is composed of freelancers, with some degree of sponsorship by the Chinese government.APT19 used three different techniques to attempt to compromise targets. In early May, the phishing lures leveraged RTF attachments that exploited the Microsoft Windows vulnerability described in CVE 2017-0199. Toward the end of May, APT19 switched to using macro-enabled Microsoft Excel (XLSM) documents. In the most recent versions, APT19 added an application whitelisting bypass to the macro-enabled Microsoft Excel (XLSM) documents. At least one observed phishing lure delivered a Cobalt Strike payload. // Refs.: https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/06/phished-at-the-request-of-counsel.html // IoC: https://privateer.one/threatintel/429599282999689956863384832.json</div>
